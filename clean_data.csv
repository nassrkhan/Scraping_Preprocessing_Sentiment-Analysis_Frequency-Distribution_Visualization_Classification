Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.
  
Data analytics is a broad term that encompasses many diverse types of data analysis. Any type of information can be subjected to data analytics techniques to get insight that can be used to improve things. Data analytics techniques can reveal trends and metrics that would otherwise be lost in the mass of information. This information can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system.
 
For example, manufacturing companies often record the runtime, downtime, and work queue for various machines and then analyze the data to better plan the workloads so the machines operate closer to peak capacity.
 
Data analytics can do much more than point out bottlenecks in production. Gaming companies use data analytics to set reward schedules for players that keep the majority of players active in the game. Content companies use many of the same data analytics to keep you clicking, watching, or re-organizing content to get another view or another click.
 
Data analytics is important because it helps businesses optimize their performances. Implementing it into the business model means companies can help reduce costs by identifying more efficient ways of doing business and by storing large amounts of data. A company can also use data analytics to make better business decisions and help analyze customer trends and satisfaction, which can lead to new—and better—products and services. 
 Some of the early days of modern data analytics are due to SQL. Created in 1979, this computing language allows relational databases to be queried and resulting data sets to be more easily analyzed. SQL is still widely used today. 
The process involved in data analysis involves several different steps:
 
Data analytics is broken down into four basic types.
 
Data analytics underpins many quality control systems in the financial world, including the ever-popular Six Sigma program. If you aren’t properly measuring something—whether it's your weight or the number of defects per million in a production line—it is nearly impossible to optimize it.
 
Some of the sectors that have adopted the use of data analytics include the travel and hospitality industry, where turnarounds can be quick. This industry can collect customer data and figure out where the problems, if any, lie and how to fix them.
 
Healthcare combines the use of high volumes of structured and unstructured data and uses data analytics to make quick decisions. Similarly, the retail industry uses copious amounts of data to meet the ever-changing demands of shoppers. The information retailers collect and analyze can help them identify trends, recommend products, and increase profits. 
 As of December 2021, the average total for a data analyst in the United States was just over $93,000. 
There are several different analytical methods and techniques data analysts can use to process data and extract information. Some of the most popular methods are listed below.
 
In addition to a broad range of mathematical and statistical approaches to crunching numbers, data analytics has rapidly evolved in technological capabilities. Today, data analysts have a broad range of software tools to help acquire data, store information, process data, and report findings.
 
Data analytics has always had loose ties to spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel. Now, data analysts also often interact with raw programming languages to transform and manipulate databases. Open-source languages such as Python are often utilized. More specific tools for data analytics like R can be used for statistical analysis or graphical modeling.
 
Data analysts also have help when reporting or communicating findings. Both Tableau and Power BI are data visualization and analysis tools to compile information, perform data analytics, and distribute results via dashboards and reports.
 
Other tools are also emerging to assist data analysts. SAS is an analytics platform that can assist with data mining, while Apache Spark is an open-source platform useful for processing large sets of data. Data analysts now have a broad range of technological capabilities to further enhance the value they deliver to their company.
 Data analytics is important because it helps businesses optimize their performances. Implementing it into the business model means companies can help reduce costs by identifying more efficient ways of doing business. A company can also use data analytics to make better business decisions and help analyze customer trends and satisfaction, which can lead to new—and better—products and services.  Data analytics is broken down into four basic types. Descriptive analytics describes what has happened over a given period. Diagnostic analytics focuses more on why something happened. Predictive analytics moves to what is likely going to happen in the near term. Finally, prescriptive analytics suggests a course of action. Data analytics has been adopted by several sectors, such as the travel and hospitality industry, where turnarounds can be quick. This industry can collect customer data and figure out where the problems, if any, lie and how to fix them. Healthcare is another sector that combines the use of high volumes of structured and unstructured data and data analytics can help in making quick decisions. Similarly, the retail industry uses copious amounts of data to meet the ever-changing demands of shoppers. 
In a world increasingly becoming reliant on information and gathering statistics, data analytics helps individuals and organizations make sure of their data. Using a variety of tools and techniques, a set of raw numbers can be transformed into informative, educational insights that drive decision-making and thoughtful management.

The primary steps in the data analytics process are data mining, data management, statistical analysis, and data presentation. The importance and balance of these steps depend on the data being used and the goal of the analysis. Data mining is an essential process for many data analytics tasks. This involves extracting data from unstructured data sources. These may include written text, large complex databases, or raw sensor data. The key steps in this process are to extract, transform, and load data (often called ETL.) These steps convert raw data into a useful and manageable format. This prepares data for storage and analysis. Data mining is generally the most time-intensive step in the data analysis pipeline. Data management or data warehousing is another key aspect of a data analyst’s job. Data warehousing involves designing and implementing databases that allow easy access to the results of data mining. This step generally involves creating and managing SQL databases. Non-relational and NoSQL databases are becoming more common as well. Statistical analysis allows analysts to create insights from data. Both statistics and machine learning techniques are used to analyze data. Big data is used to create statistical models that reveal trends in data. These models can then be applied to new data to make predictions and inform decision making. Statistical programming languages such as R or Python (with pandas) are essential to this process. In addition, open source libraries and packages such as TensorFlow enable advanced analysis. The final step in most data analytics processes is data presentation. This step allows insights to be shared with stakeholders. Data visualization is often the most important tool in data presentation. Compelling visualizations can help tell the story in the data which may help executives and managers understand the importance of these insights. The applications of data analytics are broad. Analyzing big data can optimize efficiency in many different industries. Improving performance enables businesses to succeed in an increasingly competitive world. One of the earliest adopters is the financial sector. Data analytics has an important role in the banking and finance industries, used to predict market trends and assess risk. Credit scores are an example of data analytics that affects everyone. These scores use many data points to determine lending risk. Data analytics is also used to detect and prevent fraud to improve efficiency and reduce risk for financial institutions. The use of data analytics goes beyond maximizing profits and ROI, however. Data analytics can provide critical information for healthcare (health informatics), crime prevention, and environmental protection. These applications of data analytics use these techniques to improve our world. Though statistics and data analysis have always been used in scientific research, advanced analytic techniques and big data allow for many new insights. These techniques can find trends in complex systems. Researchers are currently using machine learning to protect wildlife. The use of data analytics in healthcare is already widespread. Predicting patient outcomes, efficiently allocating funding and improving diagnostic techniques are just a few examples of how data analytics is revolutionizing healthcare. The pharmaceutical industry is also being revolutionized by machine learning. Drug discovery is a complex task with many variables. Machine learning can greatly improve drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies also use data analytics to understand the market for drugs and predict their sales. The internet of things (IoT) is a field that is used alongside machine learning. These devices provide a great opportunity for data analytics. IoT devices often contain many sensors that collect meaningful data points for their operation. Devices like the Nest thermostat track movement and temperature to regulate heating and cooling. Smart devices like this can use data to learn from and predict your behavior. This will provide advance home automation that can adapt to the way you live. The applications of data analytics are seemingly endless. More and more data is being collected every day — this presents new opportunities to apply data analytics to more parts of business, science and everyday life.

"Data analytics (DA) is the process of examining data sets to find trends and draw conclusions about the information they contain. Increasingly, data analytics is done with the aid of specialized systems and software. Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used in commercial industries to enable organizations to make more-informed business decisions. Scientists and researchers also use analytics tools to verify or disprove scientific models, theories and hypotheses. As a term, data analytics predominantly refers to an assortment of applications, from basic business intelligence (BI), reporting and online analytical processing (OLAP) to various forms of advanced analytics. In that sense, it's similar in nature to business analytics, another umbrella term for approaches to analyzing data. The difference is that the latter is oriented to business uses, while data analytics has a broader focus. The expansive view of the term isn't universal, though: In some cases, people use data analytics specifically to mean advanced analytics, treating BI as a separate category. Data analytics initiatives can help businesses increase revenue, improve operational efficiency, optimize marketing campaigns and bolster customer service efforts. Analytics also enable organizations to respond quickly to emerging market trends and gain a competitive edge over business rivals. Depending on the application, the data that's analyzed can consist of either historical records or new information that has been processed for real-time analytics. In addition, it can come from a mix of internal systems and external data sources. At a high level, data analytics methodologies include exploratory data analysis (EDA) and confirmatory data analysis (CDA). EDA aims to find patterns and relationships in data, while CDA applies statistical techniques to determine whether hypotheses about a data set are true or false. EDA is often compared to detective work, while CDA is akin to the work of a judge or jury during a court trial -- a distinction first drawn by statistician John W. Tukey in his 1977 book Exploratory Data Analysis. Data analytics can also be separated into quantitative data analysis and qualitative data analysis. The former involves the analysis of numerical data with quantifiable variables. These variables can be compared or measured statistically. The qualitative approach is more interpretive -- it focuses on understanding the content of non-numerical data like text, images, audio and video, as well as common phrases, themes and points of view. At the application level, BI and reporting provide business executives and corporate workers with actionable information about key performance indicators, business operations, customers and more. In the past, data queries and reports typically were created for end users by BI developers who worked in IT. Now, more organizations use self-service BI tools that let executives, business analysts and operational workers run their own ad hoc queries and build reports themselves. Advanced types of data analytics include data mining, which involves sorting through large data sets to identify trends, patterns and relationships. Another is predictive analytics, which seeks to predict customer behavior, equipment failures and other future business scenarios and events. Machine learning can also be used for data analytics, by running automated algorithms to churn through data sets more quickly than data scientists can do via conventional analytical modeling. Big data analytics applies data mining, predictive analytics and machine learning tools to data sets that can include a mix of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data. Text mining provides a means of analyzing documents, emails and other text-based content. Data analytics initiatives support a wide variety of business uses. For example, banks and credit card companies analyze withdrawal and spending patterns to prevent fraud and identity theft. E-commerce companies and marketing services providers use clickstream analysis to identify website visitors who are likely to buy a particular product or service -- based on navigation and page-viewing patterns. Healthcare organizations mine patient data to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for cancer and other diseases. Mobile network operators examine customer data to forecast churn. Companies engage in customer relationship management analytics to segment customers for marketing campaigns and equip call center workers with up-to-date information about callers. Data analytics applications involve more than just analyzing data, particularly on advanced analytics projects. Much of the required work takes place upfront, in collecting, integrating and preparing data and then developing, testing and revising analytical models to ensure that they produce accurate results. In addition to data scientists and other data analysts, analytics teams often include data engineers, who create data pipelines and help prepare data sets for analysis. The analytics process starts with data collection. Data scientists identify the information they need for a particular analytics application, and then work on their own or with data engineers and the IT staff to assemble it for use. Data from different source systems may need to be combined via data integration routines, transformed into a common format and loaded into an analytics system, such as a Hadoop cluster, NoSQL database or data warehouse. In other cases, the collection process may consist of pulling a relevant subset out of a stream of data that flows into, for example, Hadoop. The data is then moved to a separate partition in the system so it can be analyzed without affecting the overall data set. Once the data that's needed is in place, the next step is to find and fix data quality problems that could affect the accuracy of analytics applications. That includes running data profiling and data cleansing tasks to ensure the information in a data set is consistent and that errors and duplicate entries are eliminated. Additional data preparation work is done to manipulate and organize the data for the planned analytics use. Data governance policies are then applied to ensure that the data follows corporate standards and is being used properly. From here, a data scientist builds an analytical model, using predictive modeling tools or other analytics software and programming languages such as Python, Scala, R and SQL. Typically, the model is initially run against a partial data set to test its accuracy; it's then revised and tested again as needed. This process is known as training the model until it functions as intended. Finally, the model is run in production mode against the full data set, something that can be done once to address a specific information need or on an ongoing basis as the data is updated. In some cases, analytics applications can be set to automatically trigger business actions. An example is stock trades by a financial services firm; when stocks hit a certain price, a trigger can activate to buy or sell them without human involvement. Otherwise, the last step in the data analytics process is communicating the results generated by analytical models to business executives and other end users. Charts and other infographics can be designed to make findings easier to understand. Data visualizations often are incorporated into BI dashboard applications that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real time as new information becomes available. As automation grows, data scientists will focus more on business needs, strategic oversight and deep learning. Data analysts who work in BI will focus more on model creation and other routine tasks. In general, data scientists concentrate efforts on producing broad insights, while data analysts focus on answering specific questions. In terms of technical skills, future data scientists will need to focus more on the machine learning operations process, also called MLOps.

Improving your targeting results in more conversions and less ad waste. Data analytics provide you with more insights into your customers, allowing you to tailor customer service to their needs, provide more personalization and build stronger relationships with them.   Your data can reveal information about your customers’ communications preferences, their interests, their concerns and more. Having a central location for this data also ensures that your whole customer service team, as well as your sales and marketing teams, are on the same page. Data analytics can help you streamline your processes, save money and boost your bottom line. When you have an improved understanding of what your audience wants, you waste less time on creating ads and content that don’t match your audience’s interests. This means less money wasted as well as improved results from your campaigns and content strategies. In addition to reducing your costs, analytics can also boost your revenue through increased conversions, ad revenue or subscriptions. Turn Data Into Actionable Insights  By collecting various kinds of data from numerous sources, you can gain insights into your audiences and campaigns that help you improve your targeting and better predict future customer behavior. One valuable type of data is information about customer behaviors. This refers to data about specific actions that a user takes. They might, for instance, click on an ad, make a purchase, comment on a news article or like a social media post. This and other types of data can reveal information about customer affinities — expressed or suggested interest in activities, products, brands and topics. A customer may express interest in your brand by signing up for your email list. They may also indirectly express interest in a topic by reading about it on your website. They may express interest in a product by clicking on one of your ads for it. Some other potential sources of customer affinity data include survey responses, social media likes and video views. By combining this data with information about your current customers’ demographics, you can gain insights into the customer segments that are most likely to be interested in your brand, content or products. Demographic information includes information about customers’ ages, genders, income, marital status and various other characteristics. For example, you might find, through data analytics, that people between the ages of 18 and 35 are the most likely to purchase your product. You might also find that people who are married make up most of your website’s audience. By targeting multiple characteristics, you can create more specific audiences who are highly likely to convert. You can then use this information to predict the behaviors of various types of users and target your ads and content more effectively.  Data analytics is nothing new. Today, though, the growing volume of data and the advanced analytics technologies available mean you can get much deeper data insights more quickly. The insights that big data and modern technologies make possible are more accurate and more detailed. In addition to using data to inform future decisions, you can also use current data to make immediate decisions.  Some of the technologies that make modern data analytics so powerful are:   Let’s look at a few quick examples of data analytics and how you might collect data and analyze it to help improve outcomes for your business.  Let’s say you’re a marketer who’s running an online ad campaign to promote a new smartphone. You might start by targeting the ad to people who bought the previous version of the phone in question. As your campaign runs, you use data analytics techniques to sift through the data generated when people clicked on the ad. By examining data about these users’ interests, perhaps you discover many of them are interested in photography. Perhaps this is because your new phone has a better camera than the previous model. Using this information, you could fine-tune your ad to focus on users who bought the previous phone and like photography. You could also find new audiences of people who didn’t buy the older phone but are interested in photography. As another data analytics example, let’s say you publish a site that features videos about sports. As people visit your site, you could collect data about which videos different visitors watch as well as how highly they rate the videos, which ones they comment on and more. You could also gather information about the demographics of each user. You can use data analytics tools to determine which audience segments are most likely to watch certain videos. You can then suggest videos to people based on the segments they fit into best. For example, you might find that older men are most likely to be interested in golf, while younger men are most likely to be interested in basketball. For some real-life examples of how Lotame’s data analytics tools have helped business drive improved results, check out our case studies. While data analytics can provide many benefits to the companies that use it, it’s not without its challenges. Working with the right partners and using the right tools can help businesses to overcome these difficulties.  One of the biggest challenges related to data analytics is collecting the data. There’s a lot of data that businesses could potentially collect, and they need to determine what to prioritize. Collecting data requires tools that can gather data from website visits, ad clicks and other interactions and deliver it in a usable format. Once you collect your data, you need somewhere to store itn. This can take up a considerable amount of space and contain many different types of information. You have to integrate both structured and unstructured data from online and offline sources and from internal and external sources. You also need to ensure data quality so your results are accurate. In addition, your data needs to be accessible and not siloed so everyone throughout your organization has the same repository. Lastly, you need to have the knowledge and tools necessary to make sense of the data and provide insights.

"Data analytics enables organizations to analyze all their data (real-time, historical, unstructured, structured, qualitative) to identify patterns and generate insights to inform and, in some cases, automate decisions, connecting intelligence and action. Today’s best solutions support the end-to-end analytical process from accessing, preparing, and analyzing data to operationalizing analytics and monitoring results.  Data analytics allows organizations to digitally transform their business and culture, becoming more innovative and forward-thinking in their decision-making. Going beyond traditional KPI monitoring and reporting to finding hidden patterns in data, algorithm-driven organizations are the new innovators and business leaders. By shifting the paradigm beyond data to connect insights with action, companies are able to create personalized customer experiences, build connected digital products, optimize operations, and increase employee productivity. With collaborative data analytics, companies empower everyone to contribute to business success—from data engineers and data scientists, to developers and business analysts, and even business professionals and business leaders. Collaborative data analytics also encourages those both inside and outside an organization to connect and collaborate. For instance, data scientists can work closely with a customer to help them solve their problems in real time using the highly collaborative UI of today’s modern analytics. Data analytics propels companies forward by infusing algorithms everywhere to optimize critical business moments such as a customer walking into your store, a piece of equipment about to fail, or other events that might mean the difference between winning or losing business. Data analytics applies to all industries including Financial Services and Insurance, Manufacturing, Energy, Transportation, Travel and Logistics, Healthcare, and others. Data analytics can help predict and handle disruptions, optimize routes, deliver proactive customer service, make smart cross-sell offers, predict impending equipment failure, manage inventory in real time, optimize pricing, and prevent fraud. Analyzing data and providing actionable information to business leaders and other end-users so they can make informed business decisions is one of the largest uses of data analytics. Also known as “Business Intelligence,” data analytics is the information portal to any business. Consumers, developers, data modelers, data quality managers, business executives, operations managers, and others rely on reports and dashboards that can help monitor business progress, status, outages, revenue, partners, and more. A good data analytics solution includes a viable self-service data wrangling and data preparation capabilities to that data can be easily and quickly brought together from a variety of data sources that may be incomplete, complex, or messy, and cleaned for easy mashup and analysis. To glean insights from the data, many analysts and data scientists rely on data visualization, or the graphical representation of data, to help people visually explore and identify patterns and outliers in the data. A great data analytics solution will include data visualization capabilities, making data exploration easier and faster. Analyzing large datasets often means nothing if your analytics solution doesn’t include geospatial and location analytics. Adding this layer of intelligence to data analytics enables you to develop insights and spot relationships in the data that you might not have seen before. You can better predict where your most valuable customers are and the path they take to purchasing your products. One of the biggest uses of business data analytics today is predicting events; For instance, predicting when a machine will fail or how much inventory is needed at a particular store at a particular time. Predictive analytics involves taking historical data and creating a model of it to help predict future events. Traditionally, advanced analytics has been the domain of highly trained data scientists, statisticians, and data engineers. But with advancements in software, aspects of these roles are increasingly being performed by citizen data scientists. Many analyst firms predict that citizen data scientists will surpass data scientists in the amount of advanced analytics produced. Machine Learning involves the automation of analytical models using algorithms that iteratively learn from data and optimize performance. With available machine learning algorithms for big data, you can put your computers to work finding new patterns and insights without explicitly programming them where to look. Look for data analytics solutions that offer natural language search, image analytics, and augmented analytics. Acting on real-time events in the moment that matters is becoming a critical capability of data analytics today. Pulling data from IoT streaming devices, video sources, audio sources, and social media platforms all in real time is an essential capability of today’s top analytics solutions.  The first step to generating insights from your data is ensuring that it is organized, accurate, and actionable. Many companies start by creating a standard way to access and integrate data across disparate sources using a virtual data layer. Next, after automating data wrangling, companies can focus time and energy on acting on data outliers or inconsistencies. Next, visual analytics can provide rich, interactive dashboards for data exploration, giving companies powerful analytic capabilities in an intuitive format. Many organizations use data science to create models to provide predictive insights. Additionally, data analytics solutions now continually pull real-time streaming data for the most accurate analysis. With fresh insights, organizations can act fast, making urgent decisions simple with a clear understanding of both real-time and historic data. Today, organizations can use data analytics to inspect, cleanse, transform, and model their data. The top data analytics solutions do it all for you, allowing you to get the most out of your data and improve business strategies. Today’s top data analytics solutions simplify what used to be a very complex process. Simplifying the end-to-end analytics lifecycle within big data ecosystems like Spark and Hadoop allows you to use data science techniques at scale. Collaborating across data science, line of business, and IT teams on big data analytics projects increases efficiency and productivity for the entire organization. Analyzing high-volume streaming data both within your core business systems and at the edge allows you to find anomalies, make decisions, and take action at the point of impact. With ever-increasing volumes of data, being able to analyze, filter, summarize, and gain insight in real time allows you to find anomalies before they become a larger problem. Many organizations struggle to operationalize analytics. As data drifts and models decay, being able to retain, refresh, and automatically deploy new analytic models at the edge, or directly within core business systems, lets you understand and act on trustworthy results. With full visibility into all data anywhere, your organization can make the best decisions based on real-time, actionable insights and intelligence. Improve business outcomes by infusing analytics into the business and automating decisions. Learn more, refine, and build intelligence with a closed loop solution featuring built-in, continuous feedback. Respond to events in a fraction of a second and ensure the right people take the right actions at the right time to get issues corrected quickly. Employ microservices for edge scoring and modern serverless applications with a tiny footprint based on open source technology. Data analytics, when harnessed correctly, can be a source of competitive advantage. Organizations that approach data analytics with a focused vision can drive digital transformation, improve customer experience, and create a data-driven company culture. Using data analytics, organizations can identify new business opportunities and use insights to prioritize actions and create new sources of revenue To capitalize on the value data analytics can provide to an organization, companies must consider data for every business decision as a way to optimize outcomes and drive more informed decision-making. As data analytics initiatives become more accepted, organizations will move from traditional reporting to more advanced real-time analytics solutions. Data analytics programs within companies are evolving rapidly as digital transformation and data-driven organizations are becoming more of a priority.

"Data is everywhere and part of our daily lives in more ways than most of us realize. The amount of digital data that existsâthat we createâis growing exponentially. According to estimates, global creation of data will top 180 zetabytes. Find Our Data Science, Big Data, and Data Analytics Courses  Therefore, there is a need for professionals who understand the basics of data science, big data, and data analytics, and can do comparisons such as data science vs data analytics, which help differentiate between the various data processing disciplines. These three terms are often heard frequently in the industry, and while their meanings share some similarities, they have some profound differences. This article will give you a clear understanding of the meaning, application and skills required to become a data scientist, big data specialist, or data analyst. Letâs begin by examining each concept separately. Looking forward to becoming a Data Scientist? Check out our Data Science Bootcamp and get started today. Elevate your data management skills with Simplilearn's top-notch data management courses. Gain hands-on experience and become an invaluable asset to any organization. Data science is a field that deals with unstructured, structured data, and semi-structured data. It involves practices like data cleansing, data preparation, data analysis, and much more. Data science is the combination of: statistics, mathematics, programming, and problem-solving;, capturing data in ingenious ways; the ability to look at things differently; and the activity of cleansing, preparing, and aligning data. This umbrella term includes various techniques that are used when extracting insights and information from data. Unlock the potential of analytics with Simplilearn's top-rated analytics courses. Gain a competitive edge in the job market and propel your career forward.  Big data refers to significant volumes of data that cannot be processed effectively with the traditional applications that are currently used. The processing of big data begins with raw data that isnât aggregated and is most often impossible to store in the memory of a single computer. Big data is a buzzword used to describe immense volumes of data, both unstructured and structured, that can inundate a business on a day-to-day basis. Big data is used to analyze insights, which can lead to better decisions and strategic business moves. In summary, Gartner provides the following definition of big data: âBig data is high-volume, and high-velocity or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.â Data analytics is the science of examining raw data to reach certain conclusions. Data analytics involves applying an algorithmic or mechanical process to derive insights and running through several data sets to look for meaningful correlations. It is used in several industries, which enables organizations and data analytics companies to make more informed decisions, as well as verify and disprove existing theories or models. The focus of data analytics lies in inference, which is the process of deriving conclusions that are solely based on what the researcher already knows. Now, letâs explore the applications of data science, big data, and data analytics. Data has become the engine that drives almost all of todayâs activities, no matter if theyâre in the fields of healthcare, technology, education, research, or retail. Additionally, business orientation has evolved from a product-focused model to a data-focused one. Companies of all sizes value information, no matter how trivial that data may seem at first glance. Information analysis and visualization helps marketers and analysts acquire actionable business insights. This demand has created a need for experts who can pull useful, meaningful insights out of the terabytes of data available today. While big data helps banking, retail, and other industries by supplying important technologies like fraud-detection and operational analysis systems, data analytics enables industries like banking, energy management, healthcare, travel, and transport develop new advancements by utilizing historical, and data-based trend analysis. Data science expands on that in more ways by enabling companies to explore new strategies in scientific discovery, medical advancements, web development, digital advertisements, ecommerce â literally, anything you can imagine. In an effort to better understand the whole data science vs. data analytics comparison, letâs take a look at what each occupation does. Data scientists work closely with business stakeholders to gain an understanding of their goals, and figure out how to use data to meet those goals. They are responsible for cleaning and organizing data, collecting data sets, mining data for patterns, refining algorithms, integrating and storing data, and building training sets.Â  As for Big Data professionals, well, the term âBig Dataâ is no longer a âbigâ thing when describing a career or job position. Big Data professionals are now known more as analytics professionals who review, analyze, and report on the massive amounts of data stored and maintained by the company. These professionals identify the challenges of Big Data and devise solutions, employ fundamental statistical techniques, improve the quality of data for reporting and analysis, and access, modify, and manipulate the data. Finally, data analysts collect, clean, and study data sets to turn them into actionable resources to help solve problems or meet goals within the organization.Â  If it seems that the three occupations have a significant amount of overlap, thatâs because they do! Each business has its own structure and procedures, and you are bound to see some blurring of the distinctions between these positions. Perhaps, in some companies, the data scientist wears multiple hats. Although they are in the same domain, each of these professionalsâdata scientists, big data specialists, and data analystsâearn varied salaries.

"Today, businesses can collect data along every point of the customer journey. This information might include mobile app usage, digital clicks, interactions on social media and more, all contributing to a data fingerprint that is completely unique to its owner. However, at some point not too long ago, the thought of customers sharing information such as what time they woke up, what they ate for breakfast, or where they went on holiday, would have been a bizarre consideration to say the least. Customer social norms have certainly changed and as a result, expectations have escalated. This blog will outline five examples of benefits that businesses can reap from data and analytics in terms of driving positive outcomes for their own business and their customers, while still maintaining and facilitating the highest level of data protection. Organisations are increasingly under competitive pressure to not only acquire customers but also understand their customers’ needs to be able to optimise customer experience and develop longstanding relationships. By sharing their data and allowing relaxed privacy in its use, customers expect companies to know them, form relevant interactions, and provide a seamless experience across all touch points. Thus, companies need to capture and reconcile multiple customer identifiers such as cell phone, email and address, to one single customer ID. Customers are increasingly using multiple channels in their interactions with companies, hence both traditional and digital data sources must be brought together to understand customers’ behaviours. Additionally, customers expect and companies need to deliver contextually relevant, real-time experiences. Security and fraud analytics aims to protect all physical, financial and intellectual assets from misuse by internal and external threats. Efficient data and analytics capabilities will deliver optimum levels of fraud prevention and overall organisational security: deterrence requires mechanisms that allow companies to quickly detect potentially fraudulent activity and anticipate future activity, as well as identifying and tracking perpetrators. Use of statistical, network, path, and big data methodologies for predictive fraud propensity models leading to alerts will ensure timely responses triggered by real-time threat detection processes and automated alerts and mitigation. Data management alongside efficient and transparent reporting of fraud incidents will result in improved fraud risk management processes. Furthermore, integration and correlation of data across the enterprise can offer for a unified view of the fraud across various lines of business, products, and transactions.  Multi-genre analytics and data foundation provide more accurate fraud trend analyses, forecasts, and anticipation of potential future modus operandi and identification of vulnerabilities in fraud audits and investigations. Products are the life-blood of any organisation and often the largest investment companies make. The product management team’s role is to recognise trends that drive strategic roadmap for innovation, new features, and services. Effective data collation from 3rd party sources where individuals publicise their thoughts and opinions, combined with analytics will help companies stay competitive when demand changes or new technology is developed as well as facilitate anticipation of what the market demands to provide the product before it is requested. Companies are still struggling with structured data, and need to be extremely responsive to cope with the volatility created by customers engaging via digital technologies today. Being able to react in real time and make the customer feel personally valued is only possible through advanced analytics. Big data offers the opportunity for interactions to be based on the personality of the customer, by understanding their attitudes and considering factors such as real-time location to help deliver personalisation in a multi-channel service environment.  Poor management of operations can and will lead to a myriad of costly issues, including a significant risk of damaging the customer experience, and ultimately brand loyalty. Applying analytics for designing, controlling the process and optimizing business operations in the production of goods or services ensures efficiency and effectiveness to fulfil customer expectations and achieve operational excellence. Advanced analytical techniques can be deployed to improve field operations productivity and efficiency as well as optimize an organisational workforce according to business needs and customer demand. Optimum utilisation of data and analytics will also ensure that continuous improvements are instigated on an on-going basis as a result of end-to-end view and measurement of key operational metrics. For example, many organisations, inventory is the largest item in the current assets category - too much or not enough inventory can directly affect a company’s direct costs and profitability. Data and analytics can support inventory management by providing uninterrupted production, sales, and/or customer-service levels at minimum cost. The use of data and analytics can provide transparency into current and planned inventory positions as well as deliver insight into drivers of height, composition and location of stock and aid the determination of inventory strategy and decision making. Customers expect a relevant, seamless experience and for companies to know them wherever they engage.

"View all results Data analysis, data analytics. Two terms for the same concept? Or different, but related, terms? It’s a common misconception that data analysis and data analytics are the same thing. The generally accepted distinction is: To explain this confusion—and attempt to clear it up—we’ll look at both terms, examples, and tools. 

 Data analytics is a broad term that defines the concept and practice (or, perhaps science and art) of all activities related to data. The primary goal is for data experts, including data scientists, engineers, and analysts, to make it easy for the rest of the business to access and understand these findings. Data that sits raw, as-is, has no value. Instead, it’s what you do with that data that provides value. Data analytics includes all the steps you take, both human- and machine-enabled, to discover, interpret, visualize, and tell the story of patterns in your data in order to drive business strategy and outcomes. A successful data analytics practice can—should—provide a better strategy for where your business can go. When done well, data analytics can help you: Like any true practice, data analytics is systematic, consisting of many computational and management steps. Experts stress the word “systematic”. Being systematic is vital because data analytics uses many different activities and draws on all types and sizes of data sources. Many subject areas comprise data analytics, including data science, machine learning, and applied statistics. One tangible result of a data analytics practice is likely well-planned reports that use data visualization to tell the story of the most salient points so that the rest of the business—who aren’t data experts—can understand, develop, and adapt their strategies. Think of the many ways data analytics can highlight areas of opportunity for your business: The data analytics practice encompasses many separate processes, which can comprise a data pipeline: 

 Consider data analysis one slice of the data analytics pie. Data analysis consists of cleaning, transforming, modeling, and questioning data to find useful information. (It’s generally agreed that other slices are other activities, from collection to storage to visualization.) The act of data analysis is usually limited to a single, already prepared dataset. You’ll inspect, arrange, and question the data. Today, in the 2020s, a software or “machine” usually does a first round of analysis, often directly in one of your databases or tools. But this is augmented by a human who investigates and interrogates the data with more context. When you’re done analyzing a dataset, you’ll turn to other data analytics activities to: A vital point of data analysis is that the analysis already captures data, meaning data from the past. There are many types of data analysis techniques. Here are the most well-known: Combine these different methods depending on the business need and decision-making process. Pieter Van Iperen, Managing Partner of PWV Consultants, uses the example of web traffic, which your company very likely tracks. You have tools in place to automatically collect and measure individual metrics within web traffic, such as: Each of those data points is a small part of the overall analysis. Then, humans perform further analysis to determine things like how to optimize your website to: Analysis that is repeatable can often be converted into a new metric within your analytic platform. Brack Nelson, Marketing Manager at Incrementors SEO Services, suggests that the outcome of data analytics is more encompassing and beneficial than the output of data analysis alone. Consider the differences between: The ultimate move, Brack says, is creating a product that makes a data-driven prediction and contacts another system’s API is order to produce action—that’s data analytics in action. Analytics software are tools that help humans and machines perform the analysis that allows us to make mission-critical business decisions. Common tools for performing data analysis and overall analytics include: (Check out BMC Guides for tutorials on many big data and data visualization tools.) Interestingly, the terms are sometimes confused by data scientists and data analysts themselves! Polling a variety of people in the wide world of data revealed this divide. Most agreed that data analytics is the broader field, of which data analysis is one key function, but others had different takes. This lack of clarity underscores that maybe the question isn’t data analytics versus data analysis—but whether you’re doing both as well as you can. Several people said that they aren’t concerned if us non-data experts use the terms interchangeably. So, if you confuse data analytics with analysis at your next meeting, most folks will be none the wiser. Every business and organization can take advantage of vast volumes and variety of data to make well informed strategic decisions — that’s where metrics come in. This e-book introduces metrics in enterprise IT. Organizations of all shapes and sizes can use any number of metrics. In this e-book, we’ll look at four areas where metrics are vital to enterprise IT. These postings are my own and do not necessarily represent BMC's position, strategies, or opinion.

 This article provides some insight into the matters which need to be considered by auditors when using data analytics. The Advanced Audit and Assurance syllabus includes the following learning outcomes: In addition, candidates are expected to have a broad understanding of what is meant by the term 'data analytics', how it may be used in the audit and how it can improve audit efficiency. Data analytics has been around in various forms for a long time, but businesses are finding increasingly sophisticated and timely methods to utilise data analytics to enhance their operations. Data analytics enable businesses to identify new opportunities, to harness costs savings and to enable faster more effective decision making. Whether it is the ability to identify potential for new products and services or to detect the potential loss of clients in order to direct efforts to encourage them to stay, data analytics is everywhere in business today. At a basic level data analytics is examining the data available to draw conclusions. This isn’t a new concept but there are growing trends towards more integrated and more timely use of data from multiple sources to help inform business decisions or to draw conclusions. The data used by companies is likely to be both internal and external and include quantitative and qualitative data. This is often aided by specialised software which may have to be developed to enable the information from many different sources and formats to be first combined and then analysed. In some cases the formats covered include audio and visual analysis in addition to the usual text and number formats. The possible uses for data analytics are as diverse as the businesses that use them. They can be as simple as production of Key Performance Indicators from underlying data to the statistical interrogation of scientific results to test hypotheses. Firms may use data analytics to predict market trends or to influence consumer behaviour. Data mining of customer feedback for repeated common phrases might give insights into where improvements in customer service are needed or to which competitor customers may be most likely to move to. Voice pattern recognition can be used to identify areas of customer dissatisfaction. Police forces can collate crime reports to identify repeat frauds across regions or even countries, enabling consolidated overview to be taken. The possibilities with data analytics can appear limitless as emerging artificial intelligence can allow for faster analysis and adaptation than humans can undertake. The IAASB defines data analytics for audit as the science and art of discovering and analysing patterns, deviations and inconsistencies, and extracting other useful information in the data underlying or related to the subject matter of an audit through analysis, modelling and visualisation for the purpose of planning and performing the audit The larger audit firms and increasingly smaller firms utilise data analytics as part of their audit offering to reduce risk and to add value to the client. Bigger firms often have the resources to create their own data analytics platforms whereas smaller firms may opt to acquire an off the shelf package. There is no one universal audit data analytics tool but there are many forms developed inhouse by firms. These tools are generally developed by specialist staff and use visual methods such as graphs to present data to help identify trends and correlations. For auditors, the main driver of using data analytics is to improve audit quality. It allows auditors to more effectively audit the large amounts of data held and processed in IT systems in larger clients. Auditors can extract and manipulate client data and analyse it. By doing so they can better understand the client’s information and better identify the risks. Data analytics tools have the power to turn all the data into pre-structured forms/presentations that are understandable to both auditors and clients and even to generate audit programmes tailored to client-specific risks or to provide data directly into computerised audit procedures thus allowing the auditor to more efficiently arrive at the result. The increased access and manipulation of data and the consistency of application of data analytics tools should increase audit quality and efficiency through: The introduction of data analytics for audit firms isn’t without challenges to overcome. At present there is a lack of consistency or a widely accepted standard across firms and even within a firm*. At present there is no specific regulation or guidance which covers all the uses of data analytics within an audit. This results in difficulty establishing quality guidelines. It also means that firms with the resources to develop their own data analytics tools may have a competitive advantage in the market place effectively increasing the gap between the largest firms and smaller firms, reducing effective competition in the audit industry.  Other issues which can arise with the introduction of data analytics as an audit tool include: Data analytics tools which can interact directly with client systems to extract data have the ability to allow every transaction and balance to be analysed and reported. The increase in computerisation and the volumes of transactions has moved audit away from an interrogation of every transaction and every balance and the risk-based approach which was adopted increased the expectation gap further. With data analytics, there is a chance to redress some of this balance and for auditors to have the ability to test more transactions and balances. This may increase the chances of detecting certain types of fraud or the ability to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for a clients’ business however as yet it still can’t predict the future and the need for auditors to assess judgements and the future of the firm as well as the past means auditors aren’t replaced by computers just yet.

"The rich variety of data that enterprises generate contains valuable insights, and data analytics is the way to unlock them. Data analytics can help an organization with everything from personalizing a marketing pitch for an individual customer to identifying and mitigating risks to its business. Let's take a look at five of the benefits of using data analytics. Businesses collect customer data from many different channels, including physical retail, e-commerce, and social media. By using data analytics to create comprehensive customer profiles from this data, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior to provide a more personalized experience. Take a retail clothing business that has an online and physical presence. The company could analyze its sales data together with data from its social media pages and then create targeted social media campaigns to promote their e-commerce sales for product categories that the customers are already interested in. Organizations can run behavioral analytics models on customer data to optimize the customer experience further. For example, a business could run a predictive model on e-commerce transaction data to determine products to recommend at checkout to increase sales. Begin personalizing your marketing with data analytics today Enterprises can use data analytics to guide business decisions and minimize financial losses. Predictive analytics can suggest what could happen in response to changes to the business, and prescriptive analytics can indicate how the business should react to these changes. For instance, a business can model changes to pricing or product offerings to determine how those changes would affect customer demand. Changes to product offerings can be A/B tested to validate the hypotheses produced by such models. After collecting sales data on the changed products, enterprises can use data analytics tools to determine the success of the changes and visualize the results to help decision-makers choose whether to roll the changes out across the business. Organizations can improve operational efficiency through data analytics. Gathering and analyzing data about the supply chain can show where production delays or bottlenecks originate and help predict where future problems may arise. If a demand forecast shows that a specific vendor won't be able to handle the volume required for the holiday season, an enterprise could supplement or replace this vendor to avoid production delays. In addition, many businesses — particularly in retail — struggle to optimize their inventory levels. Data analytics can help determine optimal supply for all of an enterprise's products based on factors such as seasonality, holidays, and secular trends. Risks are everywhere in business. They include customer or employee theft, uncollected receivables, employee safety, and legal liability. Data analytics can help an organization understand risks and take preventive measures. For instance, a retail chain could run a propensity model — a statistical model that can predict future actions or events — to determine which stores are at the highest risk for theft. The business could then use this data to determine the amount of security necessary at the stores, or even whether it should divest from any locations. Businesses can also use data analytics to limit losses after a setback occurs. If a business overestimates demand for a product, it can use data analytics to determine the optimal price for a clearance sale to reduce inventory. An enterprise can even create statistical models to automatically make recommendations on how to resolve recurrent problems. Find the fastest path to data analytics All businesses face data security threats. Organizations can use data analytics to diagnose the causes of past data breaches by processing and visualizing relevant data. For instance, the IT department can use data analytics applications to parse, process, and visualize their audit logs to determine the course and origins of an attack. This information can help IT locate vulnerabilities and patch them. IT departments can also use statistical models to prevent future attacks. Attacks often involve abnormal access behavior, particularly for load-based assaults such as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Organizations can set up these models to run continuously, with monitoring and alerting systems layered on top to detect and flag anomalies so that security pros can take action immediately. To obtain the best results from data analytics, an enterprise needs to centralize its data for easy access in a data warehouse. Stitch is a simple data pipeline that can replicate all of your organization's data to your warehouse of choice. Try it for free today.

"Explore Courses | Elder Research | Contact | LMS Login Home  Blog  Data Analytics As data continue to grow at a faster rate than either population or economic activity, so do organizations’ efforts to deal with the data deluge, and use it to capture value.  And so do the methods used to analyze data, which creates an expanding set of terms (including some buzzwords) used to describe these methods. This is a field in flux, and different people may have different conceptions of what terms mean.  Comments on this page and its “definitions” are welcome.  Since many of these terms are subsets of others, or overlapping, the clearest approach is to start with the more specific terms and move to the more general. Take a 10-question quiz on analytics Used when you seek to predict a target (outcome) variable (feature) using records (cases) where the target is known.  Statistical or machine learning models are “trained” using the known data, then applied to data where the outcome variable is unknown.  Includes both classification (where the outcome is categorical, often binary) and prediction (where the outcome is continuous).  Wikipedia Basically the same thing as predictive modeling, but less specific and technical.  Often used to describe the field more generally.  Wikipedia Another synonym for predictive modeling. Data mining methods not involving the prediction of an outcome based on training models on data where the outcome is known.  Unsupervised methods include cluster analysis, association rules, outlier detection, dimension reduction and more. An older term that has come to mean the extraction of useful information from business data without benefit of statistical or machine learning models (e.g. dashboards to visualize key indicators, queries to databases).  Wikipedia This term means different things in different contexts.  To a lay person, it might mean the automated searching of large databases.  To an analyst. it may refer to the collection of statistical and machine learning methods used with those databases (predictive modeling, clustering, recommendation systems, …) Wikipedia The application of data mining methods to text. Wikipedia A broader term that includes the preparation of text for mining, the mining itself, and specialized applications such as sentiment analysis. Preparing text for analysis involves automated parsing and interpretation (natural language processing), then quantification (e.g. identifying the presence or absence of key terms). Wikipedia Cover all of the concepts described on this page.  “Data science” is often used to define a (new) profession whose practitioners are capable in many or all the above areas; one often sees the term “data scientist” in job postings.  While “statistician” typically implies familiarity with research methods and the collection of data for studies, “data scientist” implies the ability to work with large volumes of data generated not by studies, but by ongoing organizational processes.  Due to the complexity of dealing with large datasets and data flows, most of the day-to-day work of a data scientist lies in data pipeline challenges – storing relevant data, getting it into appropriate form for analysis, and managing the real-time implementation of models. “Data analytics” and “analytics,” by contrast, are general terms used to describe the field and a comprehensive collection of associated methods. Wikipedia references here and here.  All these terms tend to be used for the application of analytic methods to data that large organziations generate or have available (“big data”). Covers nearly all of the above methods, and also carries the mantle of a well-established profession dating back to the mid 1800’s.  Although statisticians work on “big data” problems, the field of statistics has traditionally been focused on focused research studies (e.g. drug trials). Refers to the huge amounts of data that large businesses and other organizations collect and store.  It might be unstructured text (streams of tweets) or structured quantitative data (transaction databases).  In the 1990’s organizations began making efforts to extract useful information from this data.  The challenges of big data lie mainly in the pre-analysis stage, in the IT domain. Our friend, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, Editor and Analytics/Data Mining Expert at KDnuggets conducted the following poll: This poll received 1108 votes, about 10% less than in 2016, but still a large enough sample. The results again show a surprising stability, fitting a pattern that emerged already in 2012, with a majority of data scientists and analysts working with data in Gigabytes range, and a small, but notable segment working with web-scale data of over 100 Petabytes. Note that the poll asks about the largest ever dataset, so a typical dataset analyzed is expected to be significantly smaller. Highlights:  Fig. 1: KDnuggets Poll: Largest Dataset Analyzed, 2014-20182018 data is shown as a column, to stand apart from lines for previous years. This poll also asked about employment type, and the breakdown was Analytics in which computers “learn” from data to produce models or rules that apply to those data and to other similar data.  Predictive modeling techniques such as neural nets, classification and regression trees (decision trees), naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines are generally included.  One characteristic of these techniques is that the form of the resulting model is flexible, and adapts to the data.  Statistical modeling methods that have highly structured model forms, such as linear regression, logistic regression and discriminant analysis are generally not considered part of machine learning.  Unsupervised learning methods such as association rules and clustering are also considered part of machine learning. The science of describing and, especially, visualizing the connections among objects.  The objects might be human, biological or physical.  Graphical representation is a crucial part of the process; Wayne Zachary’s classic 1977 network diagram of a karate club reveals the centrality of two individuals, and presages the club’s subsequent split into two clubs.  The key elements are the nodes (circles, representing individuals) and edges or links (lines representing connections). (Wayne Zachary. An information ﬂow model for conﬂict and ﬁssion in small groups, Journal of Anthropological Research, 33(4):452–473, 1977; cited in D. Easley & J. Kleinberg, Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World, Cambridge University Press, 2010, available also at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/ where this figure is drawn from.) Network analytics applied to connections among humans.  Recently it has come also to encompass the analysis of web sites and internet services like Facebook. Statistical or machine learning methods applied to web data such as page views, hits, clicks, and conversions (sales), generally with a view to learning what web presentations are most effective in achieving the organizational goal (usually sales).  This goal might be to sell products and services on a site, to serve and sell advertising space, to purchase advertising on other sites, or to collect contact information.  Key challenges in web analytics are the volume and constant flow of data, and the navigational complexity and sometimes lengthy gaps that precede users’ relevant web decisions. A combination of treatment comparisons (e.g. send a sales solicitation to one group, send nothing to another group) and predictive modeling to determine which cases or subjects respond (e.g. purchase or not) to which treatments.  Here are the steps, in conceptual terms, for a typical uplift model: 1.  Conduct A-B test, where B is control 2.  Combine all the data from both groups 3.  Divide the data into a number of segments, each having roughly similar numbers of subjects who got treatment A and control.  Tree-based methods are typically used for this. 4.  The segments should be drawn such that, within each segment, the response to treatment A is substantially different from the response to control. 5.  Considering each segment as the modeling unit, build a model that predicts whether a subject will respond positively to treatment A. The challenge (and the novelty) is to recognize that the model cannot operate on individual cases, since subjects get either treatment A, OR control, but not both, so the “uplift” from treatment Z compared to control cannot be observed at the individual level, but only at the group level.  Hence the need for the segments described in steps 3 and 4. Note:  Traditional A-B testing would stop at step 1, and apply the more successful treatment to all subjects. Reference:  “Real World Uplift Modelling with Significance-Based Uplift Trees,” by N. J.

"Historically speaking, a simple definition of analytics is “the study of analysis.” A more useful, more modern description would suggest “data analytics” is an important tool for gaining business insights and providing tailored responses to customers. Data analytics, sometimes abbreviated to “analytics,” has become increasingly important for organizations of all sizes. The practice of data analytics has gradually evolved and broadened over time, providing many benefits. The use of analytics by business can be found as far back as the 19th century, when Frederick Winslow Taylor initiated time management exercises. Another example is when Henry Ford measured the speed of assembly lines. In the late 1960s, analytics began receiving more attention as computers became decision-making support systems. With the development of big data, data warehouses, the cloud, and a variety of software and hardware, data analytics has evolved, significantly. Data analytics involves the research, discovery, and interpretation of patterns within data. Modern forms of data analytics have expanded to include: Data analytics is based on statistics. It has been surmised statistics were used as far back as Ancient Egypt for building pyramids. Governments worldwide have used statistics based on censuses, for a variety of planning activities, including taxation. After the data has been collected, the goal of discovering useful information and insights begins. For example, an analysis of population growth by county and city could determine the location of a new hospital. The development of computers and the evolution of computing technology has dramatically enhanced the process of data analytics. In 1880, prior to computers, it took over seven years for the U.S. Census Bureau to process the collected information and complete a final report. In response, inventor Herman Hollerith produced the “tabulating machine,” which was used in the 1890 census. The tabulating machine could systematically process data recorded on punch cards. With this device, the 1890 census was finished in 18 months. Relational databases were invented by Edgar F. Codd in the 1970s and became quite popular in the 1980s. Relational databases (RDBMs), in turn, allowed users to write in sequel (SQL) and retrieve data from their database. Relational databases and SQL provided the advantage of being able to analyze data on demand, and are still used extensively. They are easy to work with, and very useful for maintaining accurate records. On the negative side, RDBMs are generally quite rigid and were not designed to translate unstructured data. During the mid-1990s, the internet became extremely popular, but relational databases could not keep up. The immense flow of information combined with the variety of data types coming from many different sources led to non-relational databases, also referred to as NoSQL. A NoSQL database can translate data using different languages and formats quickly and avoids SQL’s rigidity by replacing its “organized” storage with greater flexibility. The development of NoSQL was followed by changes on the internet. Larry Page and Sergey Brin designed Google’s search engine to search a specific website, while processing and analyzing big data in distributed computers. Google’s search engine can respond in a few seconds with the desired results. The primary points of interest in the system are its scalability, automation, and high performance. A 2004 white paper on the topic of MapReduce inspired several engineers and attracted an influx of talent to focus on the challenges of processing big data (data analytics). In the late 1980s, the amount of data being collected continued to grow significantly, in part due to the lower costs of hard disk drives. During this time, the architecture of data warehouses was developed to help in transforming data coming from operational systems into decision-making support systems. Data warehouses are normally part of the cloud, or part of an organization’s mainframe server. Unlike relational databases, a data warehouse is normally optimized for a quick response time to queries. In a data warehouse, data is often stored using a timestamp, and operation commands, such as DELETE or UPDATE, are used less frequently. If all sales transactions were stored using timestamps, an organization could use a data warehouse to compare the sales trends of each month. The term business intelligence (BI) was first used in 1865, and was later adapted by Howard Dresner at Gartner in 1989, to describe making better business decisions through searching, gathering, and analyzing the accumulated data saved by an organization. Using the term “business intelligence” as a description of decision-making based on data technologies was both novel and far-sighted. Large companies first embraced BI in the form of analyzing customer data systematically, as a necessary step in making business decisions. Data mining began in the 1990s and is the process of discovering patterns within large data sets. Analyzing data in non-traditional ways provided results that were both surprising and beneficial. The use of data mining came about directly from the evolution of database and data warehouse technologies. The new technologies allow organizations to store more data, while still analyzing it quickly and efficiently. As a result, businesses started predicting the potential needs of customers, based on an analysis of their historical purchasing patterns. However, data can be misinterpreted. Someone in the trades, having purchased two pairs of blue jeans online, probably won’t want to buy jeans for another two or three years. Targeting this person with blue jean advertisements is both a waste of time and an irritant to the potential customer. In 2005, big data was given that name by Roger Magoulas. He was describing a large amount of data, which seemed almost impossible to cope with using the Business Intelligence tools available at the time. In the same year, Hadoop, which could process big data, was developed. Hadoop’s foundation was based on another open-source software framework called Nutch, which was then merged with Google’s MapReduce. Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework, which can process both structured and unstructured data, streaming in from almost all digital sources. This flexibility allows Hadoop (and its sibling open-source frameworks) to process big data. During the late 2000s, several open source projects, such as Apache Spark and Apache Cassandra came about to deal with this challenge. In its early form, the cloud was a phrase used to describe the “empty space” between users and provider. Then, in 1997, Emory University professor Ramnath Chellappa described cloud computing as a new “computing paradigm where the boundaries of computing will be determined by economic rationale, rather than technical limits alone.” In 1999, Salesforce provided a very early example of how to use cloud computing successfully. Though primitive by today’s standards, Salesforce used the concept to develop the idea of delivering software programs by way of the internet. Programs (or applications) could be accessed or downloaded by any person with internet access. An organization manager could purchase software in a cost-effective, on-demand method without leaving the office. As businesses and organizations gained a better understanding of the cloud’s services and usefulness, it gained in popularity. The cloud has evolved significantly since 1999, with customers “renting the services,” rather than acquiring hardware and software for the same purpose. Vendors are now responsible for all the trouble-shooting, backups, administration, capacity planning, and maintenance. And, for several business projects, the cloud is simply easier and more efficient to use. The cloud now has significantly large amounts of storage, availability to multiple users simultaneously, and the ability to handle multiple projects. Predictive analytics is used to make forecasts about trends and behavior patterns. Predictive analytics uses several techniques taken from statistics, data modeling, data mining, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to analyze data in making predictions. Predictive models can analyze both current and historical data to understand customers, purchasing patterns, procedural problems, and in predicting potential dangers and opportunities for an organization. Predictive analytics first started in the 1940s, as governments began using the early computers. Though it has existed for decades, predictive analytics has now developed into a concept whose time has come. With more and more data available, organizations have begun using predictive analytics to increase profits and improve their competitive advantage. The continuous growth of stored data, combined with an increasing interest in using data to gain Business Intelligence, has promoted the use of predictive analytics. Most organizations deal with unstructured data. Making sense of this unstructured data is not something humans can easily do. Cognitive analytics merges a variety of applications to provide context and answers. Organizations can collect data from several different sources, and cognitive analytics can examine the unstructured data in-depth, offering decision-makers a better understanding of their internal processes, customer preferences, and customer loyalty. Augmented analytics provides automated Business Intelligence (and insights) by using natural language processing and machine learning. It “automates” data preparation and enables data sharing. Augmented analytics provides clear results, and access to sophisticated tools, allowing researchers and managers to make daily decisions with a high degree of confidence. It allows decision-makers to gain insights and act quickly and confidently. Ultimately, augmented analytics attempts to reduce the work of data scientists by automating the steps used in gaining insights and business intelligence. An augmented analytics engine will automatically process an organization’s data, clean the data, analyze it, and then produce insights leading to instructions for executives or salespeople. Portfolio analytics is often used by a lending agency or a bank, and is a collection of accounts with varying values and risks. The accounts in the portfolio may include information about their client’s social status (poor, middle-class, wealthy), their geographical location, and many other factors. Portfolio analytics allow the lender to balance the returns on a loan with the risk for default. The risk of the loan is determined by such things as income, the success of previous loans, and declarations of bankruptcy. Originally called “people analytics,” HR analytics is behavioral data that is used in understanding how people work and how they change the way organizations are managed. HR analytics has also been called workforce analytics, talent analytics, talent insights, people insights, colleague insights, and human capital analytics. HR analytics is used to help businesses manage their human resources, and is a strategic tool for analyzing and forecasting trends in the labor markets. The customer journey deals with the holistic experience customers go through while interacting with an organization, or brand. Instead of focusing on a portion of the experience, the customer journey records the full experience of a customer. Customer journey analytics examines the recorded information and provides insights about customer experiences (often in real-time). It helps in understanding the customer, and influences how companies design the customer experience. Customer journey analytics supports a systematic method of evaluating and monitoring the customer’s journey and improving the process. Developing and delivering the optimal customer experience is the ultimate goal. Photo Credit: Image used under license from Shutterstock.com You must be logged in to post a comment.

Industry Advice
Analytics
Computing and IT
 Dan Ariely, a well-known behavioral economics expert, once said about big data: “Everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it.” This concept applies to a great deal of data terminology. While many people toss around terms like “data science,” “data analysis,” “big data,” and “data mining,” even the experts have trouble defining them. Here, we focus on one of the more important distinctions as it relates to your career: the often-muddled differences between data analytics and data science. Download our free guide to explore career opportunities in computer and data science. DOWNLOAD NOW While data analysts and data scientists both work with data, the main difference lies in what they do with it. Data analysts examine large data sets to identify trends, develop charts, and create visual presentations to help businesses make more strategic decisions. Data scientists, on the other hand, design and construct new processes for data modeling and production using prototypes, algorithms, predictive models, and custom analysis. The responsibility of data analysts can vary across industries and companies, but fundamentally, data analysts utilize data to draw meaningful insights and solve problems. They analyze well-defined sets of data using an arsenal of different tools to answer tangible business needs: e.g. why sales dropped in a certain quarter, why a marketing campaign fared better in certain regions, how internal attrition affects revenue, etc.  Data analysts have a range of fields and titles, including (but not limited to) database analyst, business analyst, market research analyst, sales analyst, financial analyst, marketing analyst, advertising analyst, customer success analyst, operations analyst, pricing analyst, and international strategy analyst. The best data analysts have both technical expertise and the ability to communicate quantitative findings to non-technical colleagues or clients. Data analysts can have a background in mathematics and statistics, or they can supplement a non-quantitative background by learning the tools needed to make decisions with numbers. Some data analysts choose to pursue an advanced degree, such as a master’s in analytics, in order to advance their careers. Working professionals that are considering changing careers could benefit if they have experience in mathematical or statistical fields. Adding the pursuit of an advanced degree in the data industry will greatly impact their job opportunities and make for a smooth transition into a data analysis position. Top data analyst skills include data mining/data warehouse, data modeling, R or SAS, SQL, statistical analysis, database management & reporting, and data analysis. Data analysts are often responsible for designing and maintaining data systems and databases, using statistical tools to interpret data sets, and preparing reports that effectively communicate trends, patterns, and predictions based on relevant findings. Learn More: What Does a Data Analyst Do?  Data scientists, on the other hand, estimate the unknown by asking questions, writing algorithms, and building statistical models. The main difference between a data analyst and a data scientist is heavy coding. Data scientists can arrange undefined sets of data using multiple tools at the same time, and build their own automation systems and frameworks.  Drew Conway, data science expert and founder of Alluvium, describes a data scientist as someone who has mathematical and statistical knowledge, hacking skills, and substantive expertise. As such, many data scientists hold degrees such as a master’s in data science.  These include machine learning, software development, Hadoop, Java, data mining/data warehouse, data analysis, python, and object-oriented programming Data scientists are typically tasked with designing data modeling processes, as well as creating algorithms and predictive models to extract the information needed by an organization to solve complex problems. Learn More: What Does a Data Scientist Do? Once you have a firm understanding of the differences between data analytics and data science—and can identify what each career entails—you can start evaluating which path is the right fit for you. To determine which path is best aligned with your personal and professional goals, you should consider three key factors. While data analysts and data scientists are similar in many ways, their differences are rooted in their professional and educational backgrounds, says Martin Schedlbauer, professor and director of the information, data science and data analytics programs within Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences, including the Master of Science in Computer Science and Master of Science in Data Science. As mentioned above, data analysts examine large data sets to identify trends, develop charts, and create visual presentations to help businesses make more strategic decisions. To align their education with these tasks, analysts typically pursue an undergraduate degree in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) major, and sometimes even an advanced degree in analytics or a related field. They also seek out experience in math, science, programming, databases, modeling, and predictive analytics. Learn More: Is a Master’s in Analytics Worth It? Data scientists, on the other hand, are more focused on designing and constructing new processes for data modeling and production. Because they use a variety of techniques like data mining and machine learning to comb through data, an advanced degree such as a master’s in data science is essential for professional advancement, according to Schedlbauer. “Data scientists are…much more technical and mathematical [than data analysts],” he says, explaining that this requires them to have “more of a background in computer science,” as well. When considering which career path is right for you, it’s important to review these educational requirements. If you have already made the decision to invest in your career with an advanced degree, you will likely have the educational and experiential background to pursue either path. On the other hand, if you’re still in the process of deciding if going back to school is right for you, you may be more inclined to stick with a data analytics role, as employers are more likely to consider candidates without a master’s degree for these positions. No matter which path you choose, thinking through your current and desired amount of education and experience should help you narrow down your options. If you do decide to pursue a graduate degree to kickstart your career, be sure to find a program that will help you achieve your goals. For example, programs offered by Northeastern put an emphasis on experiential learning, allowing students to develop the skills and hands-on experience that they need to excel in the workplace. Are you excited by numbers and statistics, or do your passions extend into computer science and business? Data analysts love numbers, statistics, and programming. As the gatekeepers for their organization’s data, they work almost exclusively in databases to uncover data points from complex and often disparate sources. Data analysts should also have a comprehensive understanding of the industry they work in, Schedlbauer says. If this sounds like you, then a data analytics role may be the best professional fit for your interests. Data scientists are required to have a blend of math, statistics, and computer science, as well as an interest in—and knowledge of—the business world. If this description better aligns with your background and experience, perhaps a role as a data scientist is the right pick for you.  Either way, understanding which career matches your personal interests will help you get a better idea of the kind of work that you’ll enjoy and likely excel at. Be sure to take the time and think through this part of the equation, as aligning your work with your interests can go a long way in keeping you satisfied in your career for years to come.  Different levels of experience are required for data scientists and data analysts, resulting in different levels of compensation for these roles.  Data analysts have an earning potential of between $83,750 and $142,500. Since these professionals work mainly in databases, however, they are able to increase their salaries by learning additional programming skills, such as R and Python. According to PayScale, however, data analysts with more than 10 years of experience often maximize their earning potential and move on to other jobs. Two common career moves—after the acquisition of an advanced degree—include transitioning into a developer role or data scientist position, according to Blake Angove, director of technology services at IT recruiting firm LaSalle Network. Data scientists—who typically have a graduate degree, boast advanced skills, and are often more experienced—are considered more senior than data analysts, according to Schedlbauer. As such, they are often better compensated for their work. According to RHT, data scientists earn an average annual salary between $105,750 and $180,250 per year. The career trajectory for professionals in data science is positive as well, with many opportunities for advancement to senior roles such as data architect or data engineer. Data analysts and data scientists have job titles that are deceptively similar, given the many differences in role responsibilities, educational requirements, and career trajectory. No matter how you look at it, however, Schedlbauer explains that qualified individuals for data-focused careers are highly coveted in today’s job market, thanks to businesses’ strong need to make sense of—and capitalize on—their data. Once you have considered factors like your background, personal interests, and desired salary, you can decide which career is the right fit for you and get started on your path to success.

The data-analytics revolution now under way has the potential to transform how companies organize, operate, manage talent, and create value. Thatâs starting to happen in a few companiesâtypically ones that are reaping major rewards from their dataâbut itâs far from the norm. Thereâs a simple reason: CEOs and other top executives, the only people who can drive the broader business changes needed to fully exploit advanced analytics, tend to avoid getting dragged into the esoteric âweeds.â On one level, this is understandable. The complexity of the methodologies, the increasing importance of machine learning, and the sheer scale of the data sets make it tempting for senior leaders to âleave it to the experts.â 
But thatâs also a mistake. Advanced data analytics is a quintessential business matter. That means the CEO and other top executives must be able to clearly articulate its purpose and then translate it into actionânot just in an analytics department, but throughout the organization where the insights will be used. 
This article describes eight critical elements contributing to clarity of purpose and an ability to act. Weâre convinced that leaders with strong intuition about both donât just become better equipped to âkick the tiresâ on their analytics efforts. They can also more capably address many of the critical and complementary top-management challenges facing them: the need to ground even the highest analytical aspirations in traditional business principles, the importance of deploying a range of tools and employing the right personnel, and the necessity of applying hard metrics and asking hard questions. (For more on these, see âStraight talk about big data.â1 1.
For more on the context and challenges of harnessing insights from more data and on using new methods, tools, and skills to do so, see âIs big data still a thing?,â blog entry by Matt Turck, February 1, 2016, mattturck.com; David Court, âGetting big impact from big data,â McKinsey Quarterly, January 2015; and Brad Brown, David Court, and Paul Willmott, âMobilizing your C-suite for big-data analytics,â McKinsey Quarterly, November 2013.
 ) All that, in turn, boosts the odds of improving corporate performance through analytics. 
After all, performanceânot pristine data sets, interesting patterns, or killer algorithmsâis ultimately the point. Advanced data analytics is a means to an end. Itâs a discriminating tool to identify, and then implement, a value-driving answer. And youâre much likelier to land on a meaningful one if youâre clear on the purpose of your data (which we address in this articleâs first four principles) and the uses youâll be putting your data to (our focus in the next four). That answer will of course look different in different companies, industries, and geographies, whose relative sophistication with advanced data analytics is all over the map. Whatever your starting point, though, the insights unleashed by analytics should be at the core of your organizationâs approach to define and improve performance continually as competitive dynamics evolve. Otherwise, youâre not making advanced analytics work for you. 
âBetter performanceâ will mean different things to different companies. And it will mean that different types of data should be isolated, aggregated, and analyzed depending upon the specific use case. Sometimes, data points are hard to find, and, certainly, not all data points are equal. But itâs the data points that help meet your specific purpose that have the most value. 
The precise question your organization should ask depends on your best-informed priorities. Clarity is essential. Examples of good questions include âhow can we reduce costs?â or âhow can we increase revenues?â Even better are questions that drill further down: âHow can we improve the productivity of each member of our team?â âHow can we improve the quality of outcomes for patients?â âHow can we radically speed our time to market for product development?â Think about how you can align important functions and domains with your most important use cases. Iterate through to actual business examples, and probe to where the value lies. In the real world of hard constraints on funds and time, analytic exercises rarely pay off for vaguer questions such as âwhat patterns do the data points show?â 
One large financial company erred by embarking on just that sort of open-ended exercise: it sought to collect as much data as possible and then see what turned up. When findings emerged that were marginally interesting but monetarily insignificant, the team refocused. With strong C-suite support, it first defined a clear purpose statement aimed at reducing time in product development and then assigned a specific unit of measure to that purpose, focused on the rate of customer adoption. A sharper focus helped the company introduce successful products for two market segments. Similarly, another organization we know plunged into data analytics by first creating a âdata lake.â It spent an inordinate amount of time (years, in fact) to make the data pristine but invested hardly any thought in determining what the use cases should be. Management has since begun to clarify its most pressing issues. But the world is rarely patient. 
Had these organizations put the question horse before the data-collection cart, they surely would have achieved an impact sooner, even if only portions of the data were ready to be mined. For example, a prominent automotive company focused immediately on the foundational question of how to improve its profits. It then bore down to recognize that the greatest opportunity would be to decrease the development time (and with it the costs) incurred in aligning its design and engineering functions. Once the company had identified that key focus point, it proceeded to unlock deep insights from ten years of R&D historyâwhich resulted in remarkably improved development times and, in turn, higher profits. 
The smallest edge can make the biggest difference. Consider the remarkable photograph below from the 1896 Olympics, taken at the starting line of the 100-meter dash. Only one of the runners, Thomas Burke, crouched in the now-standard four-point stance. The race began in the next moment, and 12 seconds later Burke took the gold; the time saved by his stance helped him do it. Today, sprinters start in this way as a matter of courseâa good analogy for the business world, where rivals adopt best practices rapidly and competitive advantages are difficult to sustain. 
The good news is that intelligent players can still improve their performance and spurt back into the lead. Easy fixes are unlikely, but companies can identify small points of difference to amplify and exploit. The impact of âbig dataâ analytics is often manifested by thousandsâor moreâof incrementally small improvements. If an organization can atomize a single process into its smallest parts and implement advances where possible, the payoffs can be profound. And if an organization can systematically combine small improvements across bigger, multiple processes, the payoff can be exponential. 
Just about everything businesses do can be broken down into component parts. GE embeds sensors in its aircraft engines to track each part of their performance in real time, allowing for quicker adjustments and greatly reducing maintenance downtime. But if that sounds like the frontier of high tech (and it is), consider consumer packaged goods. We know a leading CPG company that sought to increase margins on one of its well-known breakfast brands. It deconstructed the entire manufacturing process into sequential increments and then, with advanced analytics, scrutinized each of them to see where it could unlock value. In this case, the answer was found in the oven: adjusting the baking temperature by a tiny fraction not only made the product taste better but also made production less expensive. The proof was in the eatingâand in an improved P&L. 
When a series of processes can be decoupled, analyzed, and resynched together in a system that is more universe than atom, the results can be even more powerful. A large steel manufacturer used various analytics techniques to study critical stages of its business model, including demand planning and forecasting, procurement, and inventory management. In each process, it isolated critical value drivers and scaled back or eliminated previously undiscovered inefficiencies, for savings of about 5 to 10 percent. Those gains, which rested on hundreds of small improvements made possible by data analytics, proliferated when the manufacturer was able to tie its processes together and transmit information across each stage in near real time. By rationalizing an end-to-end system linking demand planning all the way through inventory management, the manufacturer realized savings approaching 50 percentâhundreds of millions of dollars in all. 
Beware the phrase âgarbage in, garbage outâ; the mantra has become so embedded in business thinking that it sometimes prevents insights from coming to light. In reality, useful data points come in different shapes and sizesâand are often latent within the organization, in the form of free-text maintenance reports or PowerPoint presentations, among multiple examples. Too frequently, however, quantitative teams disregard inputs because the quality is poor, inconsistent, or dated and dismiss imperfect information because it doesnât feel like âdata.â 
But we can achieve sharper conclusions if we make use of fuzzier stuff. In day-to-day lifeâwhen one is not creating, reading, or responding to an Excel modelâeven the most hard-core âquantâ processes a great deal of qualitative information, much of it soft and seemingly taboo for data analyticsâin a nonbinary way. We understand that there are very few sure things; we weigh probabilities, contemplate upsides, and take subtle hints into account. Think about approaching a supermarket queue, for example. Do you always go to register four? Or do you notice that, today, one worker seems more efficient, one customer seems to be holding cash instead of a credit card, one cashier does not have an assistant to help with bagging, and one shopping cart has items that will need to be weighed and wrapped separately? All this is soft âintel,â to be sure, and some of the data points are stronger than others. But youâd probably consider each of them and more when you decided where to wheel your cart. Just because line four moved fastest the last few times doesnât mean it will move fastest today. 
In fact, while hard and historical data points are valuable, they have their limits. One company we know experienced them after instituting a robust investment-approval process. Understandably mindful of squandering capital resources, management insisted that it would finance no new products without waiting for historical, provable information to support a projected ROI. Unfortunately, this rigor resulted in overly long launch periodsâso long that the company kept mistiming the market. It was only after relaxing the data constraints to include softer inputs such as industry forecasts, predictions from product experts, and social-media commentary that the company was able to get a more accurate feel for current market conditions and time its product launches accordingly. 
Of course, Twitter feeds are not the same as telematics. But just because information may be incomplete, based on conjecture, or notably biased does not mean that it should be treated as âgarbage.â Soft information does have value. Sometimes, it may even be essential, especially when people try to âconnect the dotsâ between more exact inputs or make a best guess for the emerging future. 
To optimize available information in an intelligent, nuanced way, companies should strive to build a strong data provenance model that identifies the source of every input and scores its reliability, which may improve or degrade over time. Recording the quality of dataâand the methodologies used to determine itâis not only a matter of transparency but also a form of risk management. All companies compete under uncertainty, and sometimes the data underlying a key decision may be less certain than one would like. A well-constructed provenance model can stress-test the confidence for a go/no-go decision and help management decide when to invest in improving a critical data set. 
Insights often live at the boundaries. Just as considering soft data can reveal new insights, combining oneâs sources of information can make those insights sharper still. Too often, organizations drill down on a single data set in isolation but fail to consider what different data sets convey in conjunction. For example, HR may have thorough employee-performance data; operations, comprehensive information about specific assets; and finance, pages of backup behind a P&L. Examining each cache of information carefully is certainly useful. But additional untapped value may be nestled in the gullies among separate data sets. 
One industrial company provides an instructive example. The core business used a state-of-the-art machine that could undertake multiple processes. It also cost millions of dollars per unit, and the company had bought hundreds of themâan investment of billions. The machines provided best-in-class performance data, and the company could, and did, measure how each unit functioned over time. It would not be a stretch to say that keeping the machines up and running was critical to the companyâs success. 
Even so, the machines required longer and more costly repairs than management had expected, and every hour of downtime affected the bottom line. Although a very capable analytics team embedded in operations sifted through the asset data meticulously, it could not find a credible cause for the breakdowns. Then, when the performance results were considered in conjunction with information provided by HR, the reason for the subpar output became clear: machines were missing their scheduled maintenance checks because the personnel responsible were absent at critical times. Payment incentives, not equipment specifications, were the real root cause. A simple fix solved the problem, but it became apparent only when different data sets were examined together. 
One visual that comes to mind in the case of the preceding industrial company is that of a Venn Diagram: when you look at 2 data sets side by side, a key insight becomes clear through the overlap. And when you consider 50 data sets, the insights are even more powerfulâif the quest for diverse data doesnât create overwhelming complexity that actually inhibits the use of analytics. To avoid this problem, leaders should push their organizations to take a multifaceted approach in analyzing data. If analyses are run in silos, if the outputs do not work under real-world conditions, or, perhaps worst of all, if the conclusions would work but sit unused, the analytics exercise has failed. 
Data analytics needs a purpose and a plan. But as the saying goes, âno battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.â To that, weâd add another military insightâthe OODA loop, first conceived by US colonel John Boyd: the decision cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act. Victory, Boyd posited, often resulted from the way decisions are made; the side that reacts to situations more quickly and processes new information more accurately should prevail. The decision process, in other words, is a loop orâmore correctlyâa dynamic series of loops (exhibit). 
Best-in-class organizations adopt this approach to their competitive advantage. Google, for one, insistently makes data-focused decisions, builds consumer feedback into solutions, and rapidly iterates products that people not only use but love. A loops-not-lines approach works just as well outside of Silicon Valley. We know of a global pharmaceutical company, for instance, that tracks and monitors its data to identify key patterns, moves rapidly to intervene when data points suggest that a process may move off track, and refines its feedback loop to speed new medications through trials. And a consumer-electronics OEM moved quickly from collecting data to âdoing the mathâ with an iterative, hypothesis-driven modeling cycle. It first created an interim data architecture, building three âinsights factoriesâ that could generate actionable recommendations for its highest-priority use cases, and then incorporated feedback in parallel. All of this enabled its early pilots to deliver quick, largely self-funding results. 
Digitized data points are now speeding up feedback cycles. By using advanced algorithms and machine learning that improves with the analysis of every new input, organizations can run loops that are faster and better. But while machine learning very much has its place in any analytics tool kit, it is not the only tool to use, nor do we expect it to supplant all other analyses. Weâve mentioned circular Venn Diagrams; people more partial to three-sided shapes might prefer the term âtriangulate.â But the concept is essentially the same: to arrive at a more robust answer, use a variety of analytics techniques and combine them in different ways. 
In our experience, even organizations that have built state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms and use automated looping will benefit from comparing their results against a humble univariate or multivariate analysis. The best loops, in fact, involve people and machines. A dynamic, multipronged decision process will outperform any single algorithmâno matter how advancedâby testing, iterating, and monitoring the way the quality of data improves or degrades; incorporating new data points as they become available; and making it possible to respond intelligently as events unfold. 
While the best algorithms can work wonders, they canât speak for themselves in boardrooms. And data scientists too often fall short in articulating what theyâve done. Thatâs hardly surprising; companies hiring for technical roles rightly prioritize quantitative expertise over presentation skills. But mind the gap, or face the consequences. One world-class manufacturer we know employed a team that developed a brilliant algorithm for the options pricing of R&D projects. The data points were meticulously parsed, the analyses were intelligent and robust, and the answers were essentially correct. But the organizationâs decision makers found the end product somewhat complicated and didnât use it. 
Weâre all human after all, and appearances matter. Thatâs why a beautiful interface will get you a longer look than a detailed computation with an uneven personality. Thatâs also why the elegant, intuitive usability of products like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat is making its way into the enterprise. Analytics should be consumable, and best-in-class organizations now include designers on their core analytics teams. Weâve found that workers throughout an organization will respond better to interfaces that make key findings clear and that draw users in. 
Drawing your users inâand tapping the capabilities of different individuals across your organization to do soâis essential. Analytics is a team sport. Decisions about which analyses to employ, what data sources to mine, and how to present the findings are matters of human judgment. 
Assembling a great team is a bit like creating a gourmet delightâyou need a mix of fine ingredients and a dash of passion. Key team members include data scientists, who help develop and apply complex analytical methods; engineers with skills in areas such as microservices, data integration, and distributed computing; cloud and data architects to provide technical and systemwide insights; and user-interface developers and creative designers to ensure that products are visually beautiful and intuitively useful. You also need âtranslatorsââmen and women who connect the disciplines of IT and data analytics with business decisions and management. 
In our experienceâand, we expect, in yours as wellâthe demand for people with the necessary capabilities decidedly outstrips the supply. Weâve also seen that simply throwing money at the problem by paying a premium for a cadre of new employees typically doesnât work. What does is a combination: a few strategic hires, generally more senior people to help lead an analytics group; in some cases, strategic acquisitions or partnerships with small data-analytics service firms; and, especially, recruiting and reskilling current employees with quantitative backgrounds to join in-house analytics teams. 
Weâre familiar with several financial institutions and a large industrial company that pursued some version of these paths to build best-in-class advanced data-analytics groups. A key element of each organizationâs success was understanding both the limits that any one individual can be expected to contribute and the potential that an engaged team with complementary talents can collectively achieve. On occasion, one can find ârainbow unicornâ employees who embody most or all of the needed capabilities. Itâs a better bet, though, to build a collaborative team comprising people who collectively have all the necessary skills. 
That starts, of course, with people at the âpoint of the spearââthose who actively parse through the data points and conduct the hard analytics. Over time, however, we expect that organizations will move to a model in which people across functions use analytics as part of their daily activities. Already, the characteristics of promising data-minded employees are not hard to see: they are curious thinkers who can focus on detail, get energized by ambiguity, display openness to diverse opinions and a willingness to iterate together to produce insights that make sense, and are committed to real-world outcomes. That last point is critical because your company is not supposed to be running some cool science experiment (however cool the analytics may be) in isolation. You and your employees are striving to discover practicable insightsâand to ensure that the insights are used. 
Culture makes adoption possible. And from the moment your organization embarks on its analytics journey, it should be clear to everyone that math, data, and even design are not enough: the real power comes from adoption. An algorithm should not be a point solutionâcompanies must embed analytics in the operating models of real-world processes and day-to-day work flows. Bill Klem, the legendary baseball umpire, famously said, âIt ainât nothinâ until I call it.â Data analytics ainât nothinâ until you use it. 
Weâve seen too many unfortunate instances that serve as cautionary talesâfrom detailed (and expensive) seismology forecasts that team foremen didnât use to brilliant (and amazingly accurate) flight-system indicators that airplane pilots ignored. In one particularly striking case, a company we know had seemingly pulled everything together: it had a clearly defined mission to increase top-line growth, robust data sources intelligently weighted and mined, stellar analytics, and insightful conclusions on cross-selling opportunities. There was even an elegant interface in the form of pop-ups that would appear on the screen of call-center representatives, automatically triggered by voice-recognition software, to prompt certain products, based on what the customer was saying in real time. Utterly brilliantâexcept the representatives kept closing the pop-up windows and ignoring the prompts. Their pay depended more on getting through calls quickly and less on the number and type of products they sold. 
When everyone pulls together, though, and incentives are aligned, the results can be remarkable. For example, one aerospace firm needed to evaluate a range of R&D options for its next-generation products but faced major technological, market, and regulatory challenges that made any outcome uncertain. Some technology choices seemed to offer safer bets in light of historical results, and other, high-potential opportunities appeared to be emerging but were as yet unproved. Coupled with an industry trajectory that appeared to be shifting from a product- to service-centric model, the range of potential paths and complex âprosâ and âconsâ required a series of dynamicâand, of course, accurateâdecisions. 
By framing the right questions, stress-testing the options, and, not least, communicating the trade-offs with an elegant, interactive visual model that design skills made beautiful and usable, the organization discovered that increasing investment along one R&D path would actually keep three technology options open for a longer period. This bought the company enough time to see which way the technology would evolve and avoided the worst-case outcome of being locked into a very expensive, and very wrong, choice. One executive likened the resulting flexibility to âthe choice of betting on a horse at the beginning of the race or, for a premium, being able to bet on a horse halfway through the race.â 
Itâs not a coincidence that this happy ending concluded as the initiative had begun: with senior managementâs engagement. In our experience, the best day-one indicator for a successful data-analytics program is not the quality of data at hand, or even the skill-level of personnel in house, but the commitment of company leadership. It takes a C-suite perspective to help identify key business questions, foster collaboration across functions, align incentives, and insist that insights be used. Advanced data analytics is wonderful, but your organization should not be working merely to put an advanced-analytics initiative in place. The very point, after all, is to put analytics to work for you.

"Data analytics trends like the growth of AIOps and ""small data"" are influencing this emerging technology, enabling it to progress at a faster rate. 
 Data analytics has become a chief driver of competitive advantage in the last few years. Given its critical importance, it’s essential that businesses stay current with top trends in the data analytics space, along with how those trends influence a number of related technologies. Those related technologies include cloud computing, the growth in artificial intelligence software, machine learning, and edge computing, among several others. Let’s explore some top trends shaping the future of data analytics. The growth of AIOps is parallel that of data analytics. This is because it addresses the biggest issue that data analysis faces moving forward: abundance. With the evolution of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as higher consumer and user analytics, IT teams handle far too much data for traditional methods to handle. AIOps accounts for this, and moves towards a holistic approach towards analyzing data. Expect AIOps to accelerate the transition away from data silos. The rise of AIOps will bring a number of benefits for how businesses leverage data and analytics. One major benefit of the growth of AIOps is preventing alert fatigue. Because AIOps account for a massive amount of data, software solutions built with AIOps at their core can filter through alerts by understanding which events are essential and immediate, and which are less important outliers. Data democratization refers to the practice of making data accessible throughout all departments of a business, not just the C-suite and IT team. Data democratization is at the core of digital transformation. This idea of understanding and accessing data no matter your tech expertise can bring about new self-service data analytics tools. We’re already seeing this with low-code solutions. There are a number of benefits to data democratization to look forward to: As mentioned above, low-code solutions are on the rise. A huge reason for this is the growth of data democratization and the industry-wide embrace of data analytics as a whole. This rise of solutions that allow for data analysis in a user-friendly manner can bring about major shifts for businesses. One of the major benefits behind the rise of low-code solutions is improved access to analysis of customer journeys. Low-code solutions allow for departments other than your development and IT teams to analyze data. Giving other departments this access will not only grow company culture and provide more in-depth analysis, but also upskill employees as a whole. With the rise of data democratization on the horizon, expect the overall experience of attaining data to grow easier as well. One of the main ways this is expected to occur is through stronger data integration in software solutions that employees already use. Instead of data analytics being siloed away into their own programs, insights can directly show up in applications and interfaces businesses already work with. Data integration goes hand in hand with greater efficiency as well. This is because users can receive relevant data and information directly without switching software. This eliminates potential user error due to the lack of searching that employees need to do to find data. The idea of small and wide data has grown as a counterpart to big data. This trend points to a new way of thinking about and analyzing data sets. Wide data enables analysis from a variety of unstructured and structured sources. This wide variety allows for greater contextual understanding, which could lead to better or more unique solutions. Small data extracts from data models that have less data, but still offer unique insights. Combined, small and wide data allow for fresh, insightful contextual lenses for data analysis. Finally, expect to see data analytics move increasingly to the forefront of business operations. Businesses historically saw data analysis as a secondary function. This shift to data analysis as the leading aspect of business operations is driven by the competitive edge offered by analytics, and by today’s technical infrastructure, which supports faster processing. One of the main benefits of this embrace of analytics is the improved agility and responsiveness of enterprises. Scalability and improved revenue will surely be implications of data analytics entering the forefront of business operations. eWeek has the latest technology news and analysis, buying guides, and product reviews for IT professionals and technology buyers.

"The science of analyzing raw datasets in order to derive a conclusion regarding the information they hold Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw datasets in order to derive a conclusion regarding the information they hold. It enables us to discover patterns in the raw data and draw valuable information from them.      Data analytics processes and techniques may use applications incorporating machine learning algorithms, simulation, and automated systems. The systems and algorithms work on the unstructured data for human use.  These findings are interpreted and used to help organizations understand their clients better, analyze their promotional campaigns, customize content, create content strategies, and develop products. Data analytics help organizations to maximize market efficiency and improve their earnings.   
    Below are the common steps involved in the data analytics method:   Data can be divided by a range of different criteria such as age, population, income, or sex. The values of the data can be numerical or categorical data.   Data can be collected through several sources, including online sources, computers, personnel, and sources from the community.   The data must be organized after it is collected so that it can be examined. Data organization can take place on a spreadsheet or other type of software that is capable of taking statistical data.   The data is first cleaned up to ensure that there is no overlap or mistake. Then, it is reviewed to make sure that it is not incomplete. Cleaning the data helps to fix or eliminate any mistakes before the data goes to a data analyst for analysis.   The following are the four fundamental types of data analytics:          Companies may use the information they obtain from data analytics to guide their decisions, leading to improved results. Data analytics removes a lot of guesswork from preparing marketing plans, deciding what material to make, creating goods, and more.

"Analysis of data is a vital part of running a successful business. When data is used effectively, it leads to better understanding of a businessâs previous performance and better decision-making for its future activities. There are many ways that data can be utilized, at all levels of a companyâs operations. There are four types of data analysis that are in use across all industries. While we separate these into categories, they are all linked together and build upon each other. As you begin moving from the simplest type of analytics to more complex, the degree of difficulty and resources required increases. At the same time, the level of added insight and value also increases. The four types of data analysis are: Below, we will introduce each type and give examples of how they are utilized in business. The first type of data analysis is descriptive analysis. It is at the foundation of all data insight. It is the simplest and most common use of data in business today. Descriptive analysis answers the âwhat happenedâ by summarizing past data, usually in the form of dashboards. The biggest use of descriptive analysis in business is to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs describe how a business is performing based on chosen benchmarks. Business applications of descriptive analysis include: After asking the main question of âwhat happenedâ, the next step is to dive deeper and ask why did it happen? This is where diagnostic analysis comes in. Diagnostic analysis takes the insights found from descriptive analytics and drills down to find the causes of those outcomes. Organizations make use of this type of analytics as it creates more connections between data and identifies patterns of behavior. A critical aspect of diagnostic analysis is creating detailed information. When new problems arise, it is possible you have already collected certain data pertaining to the issue. By already having the data at your disposal, it ends having to repeat work and makes all problems interconnected. Business applications of diagnostic analysis include: Predictive analysis attempts to answer the question âwhat is likely to happenâ. This type of analytics utilizes previous data to make predictions about future outcomes. This type of analysis is another step up from the descriptive and diagnostic analyses. Predictive analysis uses the data we have summarized to make logical predictions of the outcomes of events. This analysis relies on statistical modeling, which requires added technology and manpower to forecast. It is also important to understand that forecasting is only an estimate; the accuracy of predictions relies on quality and detailed data. While descriptive and diagnostic analysis are common practices in business, predictive analysis is where many organizations begin show signs of difficulty. Some companies do not have the manpower to implement predictive analysis in every place they desire. Others are not yet willing to invest in analysis teams across every department or not prepared to educate current teams. Business applications of predictive analysis include: The final type of data analysis is the most sought after, but few organizations are truly equipped to perform it. Prescriptive analysis is the frontier of data analysis, combining the insight from all previous analyses to determine the course of action to take in a current problem or decision. Prescriptive analysis utilizes state of the art technology and data practices. It is a huge organizational commitment and companies must be sure that they are ready and willing to put forth the effort and resources. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a perfect example of prescriptive analytics. AI systems consume a large amount of data to continuously learn and use this information to make informed decisions. Well-designed AI systems are capable of communicating these decisions and even putting those decisions into action. Business processes can be performed and optimized daily without a human doing anything with artificial intelligence. Currently, most of the big data-driven companies (Apple, Facebook, Netflix, etc.) are utilizing prescriptive analytics and AI to improve decision making. For other organizations, the jump to predictive and prescriptive analytics can be insurmountable. As technology continues to improve and more professionals are educated in data, we will see more companies entering the data-driven realm. As we have shown, each of these types of data analysis are connected and rely on each other to a certain degree. They each serve a different purpose and provide varying insights. Moving from descriptive analysis towards predictive and prescriptive analysis requires much more technical ability, but also unlocks more insight for your organization. 
                    Ad hoc analysis (aka ad hoc reporting) is the process of using business data to find specific answers to in-the-moment, often one-off, questions. It introduces flexibility and spontaneity to the traditionally rigid process of BI reporting (occasionally at the expense of accuracy).

Intel® technology works at every stage of the data pipeline to make it easier for organizations to collect and analyze data for practically any purpose.
 For businesses and organizations of all kinds, transforming data into actionable intelligence can mean the difference between struggling and thriving. Maximizing the value of information requires data analytics: the process by which raw data is analyzed to reach conclusions.
While almost every organization analyzes some data, modern analytics enables an unprecedented level of understanding and insight. How far has your company gone toward a data-led, analytics-driven culture—and what’s the next step?
It all starts with the data pipeline.
Understanding the Data Pipeline
Establishing a well-developed data analytics approach is an evolutionary process requiring time and commitment. For organizations that want to take the next step, it’s critical to understand the data pipeline and the life cycle of data going through that pipeline.

Ingest: Data Collection
	The first stage of the data pipeline is ingestion. During this stage, data is collected from sources and moved into a system where it can be stored. Data may be collected as a continuous stream or as a series of discrete events.

	For most unstructured data—IDC estimates 80 to 90 percent1—ingestion is both the beginning and the end of the data life cycle. This information, called “dark data,” is ingested but never analyzed or used to impact the rest of the organization.

	Today, one of the biggest advanced data analytics trends starts right at the ingestion stage. In these cases, real-time analytics of streaming data happens alongside the ingestion process. This is known as edge analytics, and it requires high compute performance with low power consumption. Edge analytics often involves IoT devices and sensors gathering information from devices, including factory machines, city streetlights, agricultural equipment, or other connected things.
	 
Prepare: Data Processing
	The next stage of the data pipeline prepares the data for use and stores information in a system accessible by users and applications. To maximize data quality, it must be cleaned and transformed into information that can be easily accessed and queried.

	Typically, information is prepared and stored in a database. Different types of databases are used to understand and analyze data in different formats and for different purposes. SQL* relational database management systems, like SAP HANA* or Oracle DB*, typically handle structured data sets. This may include financial information, credential verification, or order tracking. Unstructured data workloads and real-time analytics are more likely to use NoSQL* databases like Cassandra and HBase.

	Optimizing this stage of the data pipeline requires compute and memory performance, as well as data management, for faster queries. It also calls for scalability to accommodate high volumes of data. Data can be stored and tiered according to urgency and usefulness, so that the most-critical data can be accessed with the highest speed.

	Intel® technologies power some of today’s most storage- and memory-intensive database use cases. With Intel® Optane™ Solid State Drives, Alibaba Cloud* was able to provide 100 TB of storage capacity for each POLARDB instance.
	 
Analyze: Data Modeling
	In the next stage of the data pipeline, stored data is analyzed, and modeling algorithms are created. Data may be analyzed by an end-to-end analytics platform like SAP, Oracle, or SAS—or processed at scale by tools like Apache Spark*.

	Accelerating and reducing costs for this phase of the data pipeline is critical for a competitive advantage. Libraries and toolkits can cut development time and cost. Meanwhile, hardware and software optimizations can help keep server and data center costs down while improving response time.

	Technologies like in-memory analytics can enhance data analytics capabilities and make analytics investments more cost-effective. With Intel, chemical company Evonik achieved 17x faster restarts for SAP HANA *data tables.2
	 
Act: Decision-Making
	After data has been ingested, prepared, and analyzed, it’s ready to be acted upon. Data visualization and reporting help communicate the results of analytics.

	Traditionally, interpretation by data scientists or analysts has been required to transform these results into business intelligence that can be more broadly acted on. However, businesses have begun using AI to automate actions—like sending a maintenance crew or changing a room’s temperature—based on analytics.

 For businesses and organizations of all kinds, transforming data into actionable intelligence can mean the difference between struggling and thriving. Maximizing the value of information requires data analytics: the process by which raw data is analyzed to reach conclusions. While almost every organization analyzes some data, modern analytics enables an unprecedented level of understanding and insight.

For organizations that want to take the next step, it’s critical to understand the data pipeline and the life cycle of data going through that pipeline. How far has your company gone toward a data-led, analytics-driven culture—and what’s the next step? The Four Types of Data Analytics
Data analytics can be divided into four basic types: descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. These are steps toward analytics maturity, with each step shortening the distance between the “analyze” and “act” phases of the data pipeline.

Descriptive Analytics
	Descriptive analytics is used to summarize and visualize historical data. In other words, it tells organizations what has already happened.

	The simplest type of analysis, descriptive analytics can be as basic as a chart analyzing last year’s sales figures. Every analytics effort depends on a firm foundation of descriptive analytics. Many businesses still rely primarily on this form of analytics, which includes dashboards, data visualizations, and reporting tools.
	 
Diagnostic Analytics
	As analytics efforts mature, organizations start asking tougher questions of their historical data. Diagnostic analytics examines not just what happened, but why it happened. To perform diagnostic analytics, analysts need to be able to make detailed queries to identify trends and causation.

	Using diagnostic analytics, new relationships between variables may be discovered: for a sports apparel company, rising sales figures in the Midwest may correlate with sunny weather. Diagnostic analytics matches data to patterns and works to explain anomalous or outlier data.
	 
Predictive Analytics
	While the first two types of analytics examined historical data, both predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics look to the future. Predictive analytics creates a forecast of likely outcomes based on identified trends and statistical models derived from historical data.

	Building a predictive analytics strategy requires model building and validation to create optimized simulations, so that business decision‒makers can achieve the best outcomes. Machine learning is commonly employed for predictive analytics, training models on highly scaled data sets to generate more- intelligent predictions.
	 
Prescriptive Analytics
	Another advanced type of analytics is prescriptive analytics. With prescriptive analytics, which recommends the best solution based on predictive analytics, the evolution toward true data-driven decision-making is complete.

	Prescriptive analytics relies heavily on machine learning analytics and neural networks. These workloads run on high performance compute and memory. This type of analytics requires a firm foundation based on the other three types of analytics and can be executed only by companies with a highly evolved analytics strategy that are willing to commit significant resources to the effort.

 Data analytics can be divided into four basic types: descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. These are steps toward analytics maturity, with each step shortening the distance between the “analyze” and “act” phases of the data pipeline. Data Analytics Use Cases

"â âBig data analytics definition: Big data analytics helps businesses and organizations make better decisions by revealing information that would have otherwise been hidden. â Meaningful insights about the trends, correlations and patterns that exist within big data can be difficult to extract without vast computing power. But the techniques and technologies used in big data analytics make it possible to learn more from large data sets. This includes data of any source, size and structure. â The predictive models and statistical algorithms of data visualization with big data are more advanced than basic business intelligence queries. Answers are nearly instant compared to traditional business intelligence methods. â Big data is only getting bigger with the growth of artificial intelligence, social media and the Internet of Things with a myriad of sensors and devices. Data is measured in the â3Vsâ of variety, volume and velocity. Thereâs more of it than ever before â often in real time. This torrential flood of data is meaningless and unusable if it canât be interrogated. But the big data analytics model uses machine learning to examine text, statistics and language to find previously unknowable insights. All data sources can be mined for predictions and value. â Business applications range from customer personalization to fraud detection using big data analytics dashboards. They also lead to more efficient operations. Computing power and the ability to automate are essential for big data and business analytics. The advent of cloud computing has made this possible. â â â The advent of big data analytics was in response to the rise of big data, which began in the 1990s. Long before the term âbig dataâ was coined, the concept was applied at the dawn of the computer age when businesses used large spreadsheets to analyze numbers and look for trends. â The sheer amount of data generated in the late 1990s and early 2000s was fueled by new sources of data. The popularity of search engines and mobile devices created more data than any company knew what to do with. Speed was another factor. The faster data was created, the more that had to be handled. In 2005, Gartner explained this was the â3Vsâ of data â volume, velocity and variety. A recent study by IDC projected that data creation would grow tenfold globally by 2020. â Whoever could tame the massive amounts of raw, unstructured information would open a treasure chest of insights about consumer behavior, business operations, natural phenomena and population changes never seen before. â Traditional data warehouses and relational databases could not handle the task. Innovation was needed. In 2006, Hadoop was created by engineers at Yahoo and launched as an Apache open source project. The distributed processing framework made it possible to run big data applications on a clustered platform. This is the main difference between traditional vs big data analytics. â At first, only large companies like Google and Facebook took advantage of big data analysis. By the 2010s, retailers, banks, manufacturers and healthcare companies began to see the value of also being big data analytics companies. â Large organizations with on-premises data systems were initially best suited for collecting and analyzing massive data sets. But Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other cloud platform vendors made it easier for any business to use a big data analytics platform. The ability to set up Hadoop clusters in the cloud gave a company of any size the freedom to spin up and run only what they need on demand. â A big data analytics ecosystem is a key component of agility, which is essential for todayâs companies to find success. Insights can be discovered faster and more efficiently, which translates into immediate business decisions that can determine a win. â â NoSQL databases, (not-only SQL) or non relational, are mostly used for the collection and analysis of big data. This is because the data in a NoSQL database allows for dynamic organization of unstructured data versus the structured and tabular design of relational databases. â Big data analytics requires a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data. The following tools are considered big data analytics software solutions: â HEAVY.AI Apache Kafka HBase Hive MapReduce Pig Spark YARN   â Some of the most widely used big data analytics engines are: â   Apache Hive/Hadoop Apache Spark Presto   â â â The scope of big data analytics and its data science benefits many industries, including airlines, banking, government, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, etc. See how analytics shape these industries and more in our full list of big data analytics examples.   Big data analytics basic concepts use data from both internal and external sources. When real-time big data analytics are needed, data flows through a data store via a stream processing engine like Spark. â Raw data is analyzed on the spot in the Hadoop Distributed File System, also known as a data lake. It is important that the data is well organized and managed to achieve the best performance. Data is analyzed the following ways: â Data mining Big data predictive analytics Machine learning Deep learning   Big data analytics takes business intelligence to the next level. Business intelligence relies on structured data in a data warehouse and can show what and where an event happened. But big data analytics uses both structured and unstructured datasets while explaining why events happened.

"Programs Programs Programs Click for Details > Education Reports Community The power of data is perhaps best captured in Moneyball. The book and subsequent film tell the story of Billy Beane, the legendary general manager of the Oakland Athletics who used statistical analysis to reinvent the game of baseball. With one of the league’s smallest budgets, Beane relied on data to predict how many runs a player would score and then built a roster of undervalued—but talented—players to compete against rivals with deeper pockets.
Spoiler alert: it worked. A little while after they adopted this approach, the Oakland A’s started to win big. They even became the first team in over 100 years of American League baseball to win 20 consecutive games.
Want to become a data analyst yourself? Our 8-week Data Analytics Program can launch you into the tech industry.
Fast forward several years, and you’d be hard-pressed to find an industry that isn’t applying Moneyball-like strategies to make smarter decisions. Telecommunications companies are tracking calls to refine their customers’ experience. Health care experts are using it to develop a deeper understanding of patients and ultimately improve outcomes. Media service providers are turning to data to not only personalize content but also produce entirely new shows for viewers. The cases of industries using data are virtually limitless. 
While organizations have more data than ever, people who have the skills to put it to good use are rare. The outcomes? Lost revenue, dissatisfied customers, disengaged employees—to name a few.  
The good news is that there’s a straightforward five-step process that can be followed to extract insights from data, identify new opportunities, and drive growth. And better yet, the ability to do so isn’t limited to data scientists or math geniuses. People across all disciplines and at all stages of their careers can develop the skills to analyze data. It’s useful whether one is looking to upskill in a career or move into an entirely new industry.

Data Collection
Data Cleaning
Analyzing The Data
Interpreting The Results

 Step One: Ask The Right Questions
So you’re ready to get started. With no time to waste in discovering what makes your customers or employees tick, you quickly set out to collect as much data as you can get your hands on by digging through records and surveys. The more the better, right? 
….Not so fast. 
Before you start collecting data, you need to first understand what you want to do with it. Take some time to think about a specific business problem you want to address or consider a hypothesis that could be solved with data. From there, you’ll create a set of measurable, clear, and concise questions that will help answer that.
For example, an advertiser who wants to boost their client’s sales may ask if customers are likely to purchase from them after seeing an ad. Or an HR director who wants to reduce turnover might want to know why their top employees are leaving their company. 
Starting with a clear objective is an essential step in the data analysis process. By recognizing the business problem that you want to solve and setting well-defined goals, it’ll be way easier to decide on the data you need.

 Step Two: Data Collection
This brings us to the next step: data collection. Now that you have a solid idea of your questions, it’s time to define what tye pf data you need to find those answers. There are three types of data:
First Party Data
First party, also known as 1P, data is data that a company collects directly from customers. This data source improves your ability to engage with your customers. It also allows you to develop a data strategy to ensure that you are catering to your customer’s interests. 
Examples: Customer surveys, purchase information, customer interviews, and in-store interactions.
Second Party Data
Second party data is first-party data given to you from a trusted partner or company. The additional benefit of this data set is that it can help you uncover more insights about your customers. This can help your company uncover budding trends and forecast future growth.
Examples: Social media activity, app activity or website interactions.
Third Party Data
Third party data is any data collected by an organization or entity that doesn’t have a direct relationship with the individual the data is being collected from. 
This data consists of unstructured, semistructured or structured data points known as big data. Big data is analysed using machine learning and predictive analytics to build industry reports. 
Examples: Open data repositories or government resources. 
Whatever type of data you use, the end goal of this step is to make sure to have a complete, 360-degree view of the problem you want to solve. 
 Step Three: Data Cleaning
You’ve collected and combined data from multiple sources. Great. But it’s not yet time to roll up your sleeves and dive into it. Here’s where you’ll spend some time polishing the data to ensure it’s in tip-top shape. 
Data cleaning converts raw data into data that is suitable for analysis. This process involves removing incorrect data and checking for incompleteness or inconsistencies. Data cleaning is a vital step in the data analysis process because the accuracy of your analysis will depend on the quality of your data.
For instance, you might clean spaces in front of letters or symbols or remove duplicates. While this may seem minor, these issues can actually be quite pernicious: even the tiniest inaccuracies can skew your results. That’s because raw data is seldom usable in its current form. You’ll often find flaws within it, like missing values. 
 Step Four: Analyzing The Data
You now have a wealth of data. You’ve spent time cleaning it up. It’s as organized as it’ll ever be. Now you’re ready for the fun stuff. 
In this step, you’ll begin to slice and dice your data to extract meaningful insights. There are many different data analysis techniques and processes that you can use. Let's explore the steps in a standard data analysis.
Data Analysis Steps & Techniques
1. Exploratory Analysis
Exploratory data analysis seeks to uncover insights about your data before the analysis begins. This method of analysis will save you a lot of time as it will determine if your data is appropriate for the given problem. There are five goals of exploratory data analysis:
1. Uncover and resolve data quality issues such as missing data
2. Uncover high-level insights about your data set
3. Detect anomalies in your data set
4. Understand existing patterns and correlations between variables
5. Create new variables using your business knowledge 
Tools and Software: Python, R and Excel
2. Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive analysis seeks to answer the question, “What happened?”. This method will identify what  is doing well and what is in need of improvement. It also lays the foundation for more advanced data analysis processes.
Example: You own a clothing store that sells products that range from t-shirts to winter jackets. A descriptive analysis will tell you which products are your best and worst sellers.
Tools and Software: SQL and DAX
3. Diagnostic Analysis
Diagnostic analysis seeks to answer the question, “Why did this happen?”. This method of analysis is the most abstract and involves detecting correlations between different variables. 
Example: Your clothing store saw a decrease in revenue for t-shirt sales. A diagnostic analysis will look at the relationship between variables such as seasonality, the location of the t-shirts within the store and social media engagement with t-shirt revenue to determine which one has the strongest correlation. In this case, you determined that seasonality had the biggest impact.
Tools and Software: R, Python, Orange, and Weka
4. Predictive Analysis
Predictive analysis seeks to answer the question, “Will this happen again?”. This method of analysis determines what is going to happen in the future based on past data gathered. 
Example: Your clothing store knows that t-shirt revenue will decrease in the winter months, but by how much? Predictive analysis will use your store’s historical data to create future revenue projections. This will give you an estimation of what your t-shirt revenue will be in the winter months.  
Tools and Software: R and Python
5. Prescriptive Analysis
Prescriptive analysis seeks to answer the question, “What should we do?”. This method of analysis determines the best course of action based on previous analyses. The result is that you are able to take action according to future trends.
Example: Your clothing store is predicted to sell 50 t-shirts in December but you only have 40 t-shirts in your inventory. A prescriptive analysis will determine that you should order 15 more t-shirts. This will meet the predicted demand and create a buffer should the actual demand be higher

 Step Five: Interpreting The Results
After you’ve interpreted the results and drawn meaningful insights from them, the next step is to create data visualizations. Data visualization involves using several tools. Let's explore two popular tools that most data analysts use.
Popular Tools For Data Visualization
Tableau
Tableau is a valuable tool that more than 220,000 data analysts use. It allows you to convert text or numerical information into an interactive visual dashboard. It also uses an API to deploy any machine learning models that you have developed.
Microsoft Power BI
Microsoft Power BI is another great tool for creating data visualizations. This software has features such as data warehousing, data discovery, and a cloud-based interface. This allows you to easily build visual dashboards. 
But pretty visualizations aren’t all that are needed here. If you want your findings to be implemented, you need to be able to present them to decision-makers and stakeholders in a manner that’s compelling and easy to comprehend. The best way to do this is through what’s called data storytelling, which involves turning your data into a compelling narrative. The goal of data storytelling is to propose a solution using appropriate business metrics that are directly related to your company’s key performance indicators.   
A Whole New Ball Game

AICPA & CIMA: As technology continues to evolve, it promotes changes to business models and surprises those who are unprepared. Businesses change their strategies and the way they operate. New threats and opportunities arise. In an increasingly data-driven world, CPAs need to be able to adapt to these technological disruptions. CPAs now often find themselves performing tasks that require skills in data analytics: In an effort to advance the use of analytics in auditing, the AICPA and Rutgers Business School in December 2015 announced a research initiative (raw.rutgers.edu/radar.html) focusing on integrating analytics into the audit process and on defining how analytics can be used to enhance audit quality. Potential improvements include producing higher-quality audit evidence, reducing repetitive tasks, and better correlating audit tasks to risks and assertions. The AICPA will use the findings from this initiative to inform guidance on audit data analytics for CPA firms of all sizes. A joint AICPA Assurance Services Executive Committee/Auditing Standards Board Task Force is developing a new Audit Data Analytics Guide, which will supersede the current Analytical Procedures guide. This new guide will carry forward much of the content included within the Analytical Procedures guide but will also include guidance on using audit data analytics throughout the audit process. Related projects are also underway to create voluntary audit data standards, which help with the extraction of data and facilitate the use of audit data analytics, and a tool to help illustrate where audit data analytics can be used in a typical audit program. Meanwhile, mastery of data analytics can help businesses generate a higher profit margin and gain a meaningful competitive advantage. Some experts even predict that companies ignoring data analytics may be forced out of business in the long run. As data analytics is an area where change may occur more quickly than companies or CPAs may adapt, change management concepts should be considered to take advantage of the opportunities data analytics can bring. Given that the price of computer hardware and cloud services has been ever-decreasing, what exactly stands in the way of companies being more data-driven? It is the human element. ""The human element of data analytics is the most critical factor in building a successful program,"" said Roshan Ramlukan, EY principal and global assurance analytics leader. ""But it's also the least understood and an impediment to further growth in this area. Leaders must also recognize that analytical skills must be developed in all of their people, not just a few data analysts."" (See the chart ""Importance of Analytics Skills"" for CFOs' ranking of the importance of data analytics skills for accounting and finance staff.) Importance of analytics skills Expertise in business analytics, such as business intelligence and data mining, was deemed mandatory for at least some accounting and finance employees by 61% of more than 2,100 CFOs participating in a 2014 survey by staffing resources firm Robert Half. Q: How important are business analytics skills, such as business intelligence, for your accounting and finance employees? Source: Robert Half survey. To better explain skill development in data analytics for CPAs, we first divide data analytics into four types as shown in the chart ""4 Types of Data Analytics."" Data analytics is often misunderstood as descriptive analysis (""what is"") only. The real value, however, lies in predictive (""what will be"") and prescriptive analysis (""What should we do?""). Data analytics is highly relevant as companies and industries transform to take advantage of technological innovations, and as expectations of regulators and investors with regard to data availability and analysis are increasing. Many accountants already use descriptive analytics in their daily work. They compute sums, averages, and percent changes to report sales results, customer credit risk, cost per customer, and availability of inventory. Accountants also are generally familiar with diagnostic analytics because they perform variance analyses and use analytic dashboards to explain historical results. This, however, is not sufficient. ""I work with many organizations, and I see that, unfortunately, the accounting function is probably one of the least analytical functions in large organizations,"" said Tom Davenport, Ph.D., a professor of information technology and management at Babson College in Babson Park, Mass. ""Clearly, it has a very strong transactional orientation, at best doing descriptive analytics focused only on structured small data. The various attempts to try to predict financial performance, getting into nonfinancial performance measures that might be good predictors of financial performance, have never really gone anywhere despite a lot of discussion over the years. This presents a great opportunity for accountants to provide a much more valuable role to management. Accounting not only has to catch up with analytics, but also needs to keep up with this rapidly changing field on an ongoing basis."" Predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics are now required because they provide actionable insights for companies. Accountants need to increase their competence in these areas to provide value to their organizations. Predictive analytics integrates data from various sources (such as enterprise resource planning, point-of-sale, and customer relationship management systems) to predict future outcomes based on statistical relationships found in historical data using regression-based modeling. One of the most common applications of predictive analytics is the computation of a credit score to indicate the likelihood of timely future credit payments. Prescriptive analytics uses a combination of sophisticated optimization techniques (self-optimizing algorithms) to suggest the most favorable courses of action to be taken. The analytics skills an accountant needs will differ depending on whether a professional will produce or consume information. Analytics production includes sourcing relevant data and performing analyses, which is more suitable for junior-level accountants. Analytics consumption is using the insights gained from analytics in decision-making and is more relevant for senior-level roles. Similar to a driver who doesn't know exactly how all the car's parts are working, CPAs do not need to become data scientists or computer engineers to benefit from the coming data revolution. It is most important that CPAs become more proficient consumers of analytics to both enhance their current audit practice with available technology as well as support their client base in undertaking data analytics activities. (See the chart ""How Skills Are Acquired"" for the methods organizations use to improve their employees' data analytics skills.) How skills are acquired In-house training is the most common method companies are using to improve employees' business analytics skills, according to a 2014 survey of more than 2,100 CFOs by staffing services firm Robert Half. Producing analytics starts with understanding the business objective (""What are the key questions that you expect the analysis to answer?"") and identifying and obtaining relevant internal and external data sources to support the analysis. Ramlukan said producing analytics often occurs at the junior level. He explained that the ideal ""analytically skilled"" employee has these three characteristics: As this ideal employee is a rare find, companies adapt by building teams of various specialties and technical skills. Production users need to have superior technical skills while consumption users should have a significant understanding of the business context. Both production and consumption users require an analytical mindset. ""We differentiate candidates who are experienced in data exploration, data visualization, and predictive modeling,"" said Brad Ames, CPA, internal audit director at Hewlett-Packard. These skill sets are not common among accounting firm personnel, Ames said, so when HP recruits for these positions, it posts job titles such as ""data scientist"" or ""analytics solution architect."" At the same time, accountants may lack the know-how about educational resources and best practices. A great way to get started on applying data analytics to the audit function is to improve one's knowledge of basic building blocks such as Excel and Access, and audit analytics tools such as ACL and IDEA. At larger accounting firms, analytics is used regularly in tax, auditing, consulting, and risk management. Ramlukan said data analytics is a skill that can be applied to many scenarios across all service lines. Employees who have this skill are therefore both very versatile and valuable to the organization. The work of CPAs will advance in the future to provide more data analysis, consulting, and decision-making support services. The audit function in particular will undergo a significant change with the incorporation of data analytics techniques. Data analytics can thus provide an important business opportunity for CPAs at accounting firms. CPAs at other organizations also are developing data analytics capabilities to support their needs. ""Over the years, I've leveraged data analytics tools for a variety of internal audit projects and continuous monitoring activities,"" said Joel White, CPA, CGMA, AICPA director—Internal Audit, Risk & Compliance. ""The tools' intuitive interface allows the user to quickly gain a grasp of large quantities of data and test 100% of various data attributes, as opposed to sampling a small percentage. Several examples of where I've used data analytics tools to analyze large data sets include corporate card transactions, payroll processing, vendor payments, health care charge capture, and customer/vendor deduping."" Data analytics tools have also been incorporated into continuous auditing/monitoring activities. HP uses data analytics technology to extract relevant transactional data and files from the database that holds accounting data and also extracts and performs analytics over unstructured data sourced externally. This information is provided to internal audit staff, external audit personnel, and business unit management to support oversight or operational activities. Given that most traditional degree-granting accounting programs do not require courses in statistics and data analysis, CPAs and accountants should seek additional training in these areas. (See the chart ""Learning Opportunities Ranked"" for a comparison of the educational value of different skill development methods.) Learning opportunities ranked When deciding on the most suitable path to data analytics education, we suggest considering the following options, which are ranked according to how employees could best approach data analytics, beginning with developing an initial understanding, developing an analytical mindset, and then acquiring specific data analytics skills. This graphic introduces these learning opportunities and ranks them by their potential for skill development. Ranking of 10 learning opportunities by potential for skill development 
In light of the changing nature of accounting practice, companies look for talent with a new set of skills. Ames said, ""The skill to deploy assurance technologies and utilize a variety of financial and nonfinancial data is highly valued."" A 2015 PwC report, Data Driven: What Students Need to Succeed in a Rapidly Changing Business World, cites the following examples for technical data analytics-related skills that accounting professionals should have or obtain: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES The advent of data analytics offers both challenges and opportunities for CPAs. The challenges include undertaking appropriate training to develop the skills needed to initiate and support data analytics activities, as well as altering the present audit model to include appropriate audit analytics techniques. The opportunities include a technology-rich audit model that provides for greater thoroughness, efficiency, and accuracy, as well as new business opportunities to provide data analytics expertise to CPAs' clients and organizations. CPAs, whether working in public practice or industry, will enhance their career opportunities through the acquisition of additional data analytics expertise.  About the authors Norbert Tschakert (ntschakert@salemstate.edu) is an associate professor of accounting at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.

"Courses Study at Ironhack Financing Options Blog Enterprise August 24, 2020  Ironhack - Changing The Future of Tech Education Data Analytics All Courses In such a faced-paced world, it's not surprising we sometimes confuse certain technical terms, especially when they evolve at such dizzying speeds and new scientific fields seem to emerge overnight. That's why in the world of big data, which involves working with enormous and complicated amounts of information, some people still confuse certain concepts, tasks and roles found within this emerging and growing discipline. One of the main points of confusion in this field is the difference between data analytics and data science, two very closely related, but distinctly different areas. Although both are found at the crossroads between maths, stats and development, the purposes they serve have clearly differentiated tangents, meaning the profiles of professionals working in the two fields are also very different. It's essential that anyone looking to specialise in big data knows what kind of knowledge and skills they will need to acquire should they decide to focus on either data analytics or data science. So, if you're currently studying with us or thinking about joining Ironhack’s Data Analytics bootcamp, pay close attention. For decades, experts have tried to narrow down the field of activity of one discipline or another, but they've not always been successful. However, since 1996, when the term ""data science"" came into use thanks to an article by Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, the definitions have come a long way and it seems that we can now clarify the scope of both fields. Below you'll find an updated Venn diagram that incorporates the different specialisations and their respective roles. Data science vs. data analytics Data science is currently considered to be a branch of big data and aims to extract and interpret information derived from the huge amount of data gathered by a particular company, whether for their own use or for operations they might carry out with third parties. To achieve this goal, data scientists are in charge of designing and implementing mathematical algorithms based on statistics, machine learning and other methodologies that allow companies to use tools that provide them with the grounds to act one way or another according to the circumstances and timing. It's also not just about obtaining information from the data gathered and being able to use it. Data scientists are also given the task of ensuring the detected patterns are visualised correctly so they are clear and legible by those who make decisions based on said data. When we talk about data analytics on the other hand, we're usually talking about a more specific and precise application of data science. That's why in industries that have incorporated data analytics, the analysts' role has been to search for unprocessed sources of information in order to try and find trends and metrics that could help companies make more accurate decisions and obtain better results. In this case, we need to be careful not to confuse their work with that of someone in business intelligence, which deals with a much smaller amount of data, meaning that its capacity for both analysis and prediction is more limited. As such, the main difference between data science and data analytics is the branch of big data each field focuses on: whilst the former is found on the road to discovery with its sights set wide, the latter is more focused on the operations of different businesses that apply and seek solutions to existing problems. So, whilst data scientists are masters in predicting the future, basing their forecasts on patterns from the past detected in the data, data analysts extract the most relevant information from the same data sets. You might say that, if the former asks questions to try and map out what will happen in the next few years, the latter is responsible for answering questions that are already on the table. On this basis, another major difference between the two disciplines is how they are applied in different industries. In fact, data science has had a huge impact on search engines, which use algorithms to provide better responses to users' queries and in the shortest time possible. Similarly, data scientists have had a significant impact on the development of recommendation systems. In terms of primarily visual content, such is the case with Netflix, or purchasing sites such as Amazon, these systems offer customers much more accurate recommendations, which greatly enriches the user experience. Netflix Machine Learning Algorithms In the case of data analytics, they are used more frequently in sectors such as healthcare, allowing health centres to care for their patients more efficiently. This discipline is also frequently used in other industries such as energy management, since, thanks to data analysis, they can optimise where resources are used and even choose to automate certain services, thus avoiding unnecessary costs. Analysts are also highly sought-after by the hospitality industry, as they can help hotels discover travellers' preferences and offer them alternatives that best suit their tastes and needs. Dashboard Booking Insights by Country As you can see, there are many factors to consider before entering into the world of big data. Data analytics and data science are very closely-related disciplines, but are not without their differences, so we know it might be difficult choosing which path to take. Here's summary of the main differences we've talked about throughout this post:  Creation of predictive models and algorithms Wider and more diverse field of activity  Expert in statistics and mathematics Experience with SQL Skilled in Python, R, SAS and Scala Advanced knowledge of machine learning Tends to work with unstructured data Apps in sectors such as artificial intelligence, health, blockchain, or website search engines Draws conclusions from different sources of data Field of activity limited to the business sector Familiarised with data warehouse, ETL tools and business intelligence Strong command of Python and R Expert in data wrangling Skilled in data visualization Business knowledge and decision-making skills Application in sectors such as retail, travel, healthcare or marketing If you are looking to specialise in the data sector and still have some questions you want to ask, don't hesitate to contact us at Ironhack and enquire about our Data Analytics bootcamps.

"Thinking about becoming a data analyst? If so, your timing is terrific, as data analysts are currently in high demand. Companies across all industries are actively looking for professionals who can gather, organize and use data to create better business outcomes. These may be data specialists, such as data analysts, or they may be professionals in fields like marketing, finance and business operations who use data frequently to guide good business decisions. No matter your job title, if you have been tasked with analyzing data, you need a certain set of skills to do so effectively and efficiently. That’s where training and certifications come into play. Keep reading to find out what skills you need and how to get them. A role in data analytics can make for a secure career with plenty of room for growth. In 2020, the Jobs of Tomorrow report, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), placed data and artificial intelligence (AI) in the seven top-growing professions, with a growth rate of 41%. That is the highest growth rate of all the professions mentioned in the report. An earlier report by the WEF claimed 96% of organizations are planning to hire those with data analytics skills. “As a result, the ‘new role’ of data analyst is forecast to be one of the most in-demand jobs by 2022,” wrote Jen DuBois, contributor to quanthub.   To get a job in data analysis, you’ll need skills that will get an employer’s attention. A few essential data analytics skills include competencies related to the following: These skills may sound intimidating, but with the right training they are attainable. You can gain these skills by training for and earning one of the best data analytics certifications on the market. Finding the right data analytics certification is easier when you have a small pool of certifications to choose from. Here’s a current sampling of some of the best data analytics certifications.  CompTIA Data+, from IT certifications leader CompTIA, is the perfect data analytics certification to start with. It gives you an inside look at the analytics process. It also validates the data analytics skills organizational leaders are looking for in a data professional. Also, CompTIA Data+ is the only data analyst certification that covers baseline data analytics skills, assesses hands-on abilities and is vendor neutral. It is wise to get a vendor-neutral data analytics certification like CompTIA Data+. Vendor-neutral certifications give you the skills you need to perform a job role regardless of the specific programs and tools you’re using. Compare this to vendor-specific certifications, which equip you to work with just one platform (such as Microsoft or AWS). Additionally, CompTIA Data+ gives you the ability to analyze and report on datasets. It trains you to adhere to oversight and data quality standards, as well as comprehend the following: CompTIA Data+ has no official prerequisites. However, it is recommended that candidates have 18–24 months of real-world experience in a role related to data analysis.  If you don’t have at least 18 months of work experience, you can still earn CompTIA Data+. You would just need to train more rigorously than someone with on-the-job experience. With dedicated training and hands-on practice, you can learn the skills you'll need on the job and to pass the certification exam. The CompTIA Data+ certification is equivalent to two years of experience in data analysis.    The good news about CompTIA certifications is that many of them, including Data+, have a complete line of training products to help you learn the concepts, practice the hands-on skills and prepare for your certification exam. Read more about how to prepare for a CompTIA exam. CompTIA Data+ and its full training suite are now available.  The Cloudera Certified Associate (CCA) Data Analyst Certification enables data professionals to pull and generate reports in the Cloudera CDH environment using Hive and Impala. Individuals who pass the CCA Data Analyst Certification understand how to use query language statements in Impala and Hive to analyze data on the cluster. They also have expertise in providing structure to data.  The best candidates for this certification are often SQL developers, business intelligence (BI) specialists and data analysts who use Cloudera. Developers, database administrators and systems architects are also good candidates. Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate helps you optimize the value of an organization's data assets by using Microsoft Power BI. It provides the skills necessary for cleaning and transforming data, as well as designing and building scalable data models. Those who earn Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate are proficient in data preparation, data modeling, data visualization and data analysis in the context of Power BI.    Ideal candidates for this certification are data professionals and business intelligence professionals. These individuals should have a working knowledge of and experience with Power BI. There are several niches within the data analytics field, such as big data analytics and business analytics. After getting a foundational data analysis certification, like CompTIA Data+, earn a certification that prepares you for the role you want. For example, if you want to go into big data analytics, seek a big data certification. SAS Certified Big Data Professional is a great choice.   SAS Certified Big Data Professional enables you to work with Hadoop. Hadoop is one of the best open-source tools for successfully storing large datasets. It enables candidates to run applications on clusters of commodity hardware and is helpful to those working with big data. Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) is an advanced analytics certification designed for those who have extensive knowledge of and hands-on experience with data analysis. Data professionals who earn Certified Analytics Professional are proficient in business problem framing, analytics problem framing and methodology selection. Model building, deployment and lifecycle management are other skills certified individuals possess. Interested in working with a certain platform, such as AWS or Azure? Opt for a vendor-specific certification, like Amazon AWS Certified Data Analytics or Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate. Although the terms data analytics certification, certificate and certificate program sound similar, they have different definitions.  Generally, certifications hold more weight than certificates and certificate programs. They prove that you possess the skill set you need to land a job in data analytics. While certificates don’t meet this standard, they are still valuable. They show employers that you are serious about learning data analytics. A couple of examples of data analytics certificate programs include: The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate covers SQL, Python, data science, machine learning and data analysis and visualization. A couple of the online courses included in the program are “What is Data Science?” and “Tools for Data Science.” The Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate by Coursera covers key information about data analytics and includes online courses such as “Introduction to Data Analytics” and “Google Data Analytics Capstone.” The latter course will help you learn to complete case studies. Data analytics certifications are designed to prove you know data management and analytics concepts and are proficient in data analysis skills. On the other hand, data analytics certificates and certificate programs are designed to help you learn more about the field. Before you can confidently choose the best data analytics certification or certificate for yourself, it’s important to understand their differences. Here’s a quick comparison of CompTIA Data+ to the most popular certifications and certificates.     Type Recommended Experience Vendor Neutral Cost CompTIA Data+ Certification 18-24 months Yes $239 Cloudera Certified Associate (CCA) Data Analyst Certification  No specified experience, but the Cloudera Data Analyst Training Course is recommended before taking the CCA exam No $295 Microsoft Certified:

"“What do the numbers tell us?” “Let’s dig into the data!” “Can we analyze this in real-time?” It’s very likely that you’ve heard these expressions around the office. Big data. Data analytics. Data science. This is important stuff.

>> Are you data savvy? It’s a key component of your Business IQ. Test your IQ here”. 
But why is this important? And what does it have to do with accounting? Accountants use data analytics to help businesses uncover valuable insights within their financials, identify process improvements that can increase efficiency, and better manage risk. “Accountants will be increasingly expected to add value to the business decision making within their organizations and for their clients,” comments Associate Professor Wendell Gilland, who teaches Data Analytics for Accountants at UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School. “A strong facility with data analytics gives them the toolset to help strengthen their partnership with business leaders.” Here are a few examples: Auditors, both those working internally and externally, can shift from a sample-based model to employ continuous monitoring where much larger data sets are analyzed and verified. The result: less margin of error resulting in more precise recommendations. Tax accountants use data science to quickly analyze complex taxation questions related to investment scenarios. In turn, investment decisions can be expedited, which allows companies to respond faster to opportunities to beat their competition — and the market — to the punch. Accountants who assist, or act as, investment advisors use big data to find behavioral patterns in consumers and the market. These patterns can help businesses build analytic models that, in turn, help them identify investment opportunities and generate higher profit margins. 
Four types of data analytics To get a better handle on big data, it’s important to understand four key types of data analytics. 1. Descriptive analytics = “What is happening?”
This is used most often and includes the categorization and classification of information. Accountants report on the flow of money through their organizations: revenue and expenses, inventory counts, sales tax collected. Accurate reporting is a hallmark of solid accounting practices. Compiling and verifying large amounts of data is important to this accurate reporting. 2. Diagnostic analytics = “Why did it happen?”
Diagnostics are used to monitor changes in data. Accountants regularly analyze variances and calculate historical performance. Because historical precedent is often an excellent indicator of future performance, these calculations are critical to build reasonable forecasts. 3. Predictive analytics = “What’s going to happen?”
Here, data is used to assess the likelihood of future outcomes. Accountants are instrumental in building forecasts and identifying patterns that shape those forecasts. When accountants act as trusted advisors and build forecasts, business leaders grow increasingly confident in following them. Tangible actions — and critical business decisions — arise from prescriptive analytics. Accountants use the forecasts they create to make recommendations for future growth opportunities or, in some cases, raise an alert on poor choices. 4. Prescriptive analytics = “What should happen?”
Tangible actions — and critical business decisions — arise from prescriptive analytics. Accountants use the forecasts they create to make recommendations for future growth opportunities or, in some cases, raise an alert on poor choices. This insight is an example of the significant impact that accountants make in the business world. 
Why accountants make excellent data scientists  Accountants have outstanding technical skills. Gilland notes, “Accountants are used to aggregating information to create a picture of an organization that summarizes the details contained in each transaction. Working with descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics comes more easily to people who already possess excellent quantitative skills.” Accountants are natural-born problem solvers. The jump from descriptive and diagnostic analytics to predictive and prescriptive analytics requires that one shift from an organizational mindset to an inquisitive mindset; a shift from stacking and sorting information to figuring out how to use that information to make key business decisions. Accountants are experts at making this jump. Accountants see the larger context and business implications. The true value of data analysis comes not at the point when the data is compiled, but rather when decisions are made using insights derived from the data. To uncover these insights, a data scientist must first understand the business context. Not only do accountants understand this context, they live it.

Project data analytics, at its simplest, is the use of past and current project data to enable effective decisions on project delivery. This includes: Descriptive analytics presenting data in the most effective formatPredictive analytics using past data to predict future performance Definition from APM Pathfinder Report Project Data Analytics: the state of the art and science  How we use data can change the way we deliver projects. Data and technology can both help us manage our projects better – they support our decision making and enable project success. In fact, data and technology are a vital condition for project success; over 70 per cent of project professionals consider them important in the Dynamic Conditions of Project Success research. Find out more about the conditions that enhance project outcomes here. This refers to the study of ‘intelligent agents,’ autonomous non-human entities that can take in information from their environment and act upon their environment in a way that enables them to succeed in their goals. Intelligent agents need to have mastered machine learning and aspects of predictive data analytics in order to be able to do this. In a project context, some people have speculated that an intelligent agent could enhance or change the roles and status of many project professionals. This is the name given to computer algorithms that ‘learn from doing’. In project terms, machine learning has, at its centre, algorithms that are used to spot patterns between some characteristic of projects or programmes and some aspect of project performance. This process gets more accurate the more it is used. Machine learning is a fundamental part of predictive project data analytics. This refers to extremely large bodies of data (or datasets). In project terms, this often refers to the historic ‘data plumes’ of legacy data that are created from the use of project control or enterprise management systems. Project data analytics (both predictive and descriptive) uses big data. How to use AI technology in project management has had a lot of attention recently and the impact of AI has become a popular topic to debate when predicting the future of the project profession. AI has potential to become a significant tool for project professionals when delivering projects. Our report, led by the University of Southampton explores how professionals view the current state of AI in project management. This research aimed to study the general perception of AI and the ease of use of AI technology within projects. The scope of the report is to find common themes of AI in projects rather than to provide specific cases of AI in projects. The research developed three research and practice-oriented objectives to reach this aim. This allowed the report to include previous research to determine the current state of AI research in project management, and to suggest recommendations based on the current perception of AI among project professionals. PwC reported that “Gartner forecasts that 80% of project management roles will be eliminated by 2030 as AI takes on traditional project management functions such as data collection, tracking and reporting.” What are the implications of this for human project professionals? On the one hand, it appears to be a loss of roles. On the other hand, association with AI could signal smartness and a future-facing attitude for an occupation and its practitioners. It may even increase demand for certain aspects of this class of expert labour. However, social scientists in the area of employment and the professions are cautious about a rush towards implementation of AI before we fully understand the interaction between occupations of expert labour and AI. This ‘pathfinder’ report assists project professionals by bringing together work in project data analytics to give a succinct statement of current progress. It gives a picture of what is happening now in this field gained from interviews with key stakeholders.  When considering the current adoption of project data analytics, it is useful to distinguish between: In order to understand the current state of the art and science of Project Data Analytics, an investigation was undertaken that pooled the existing knowledge of researchers at Manchester, Southampton, Sheffield and Warwick and supplemented this by interviewing key stakeholder groups ( e.g. relevant APM special interest groups; Data Analytic SMEs; Conventional Project Control consultancies; PMC user organisations). Interviewees were asked two key questions: The diagram below produced by researchers from the Universities of Manchester, Sheffield, Southampton and Warwick explores this further. Source: APM Pathfinder Report Project Data Analytics: the state of the art and science  Our latest guide aims to explain how data analytics can help projects and what you can do to get started. ‘Getting started in data’ is great for project professionals at all levels who wish to use project data to enable effective decisions on project initiation, delivery, and efficient automation of project tasks. It will also help you to use project data analytics to identify opportunities for improvement on a specific project or across your organisation. As the Project Management community strive to obtain predictable project performance and better outcomes, project data can help professionals to gauge the likelihood of projects being a success. Our ‘Getting started in data’ will help you to understand: This is part of a wider leading collaboration between the Data Advisory Group that we have convened with the PDA Taskforce including the Major Projects Association (MPA). Research into project data analytics is in its infancy though reviews of current practice such as that undertaken by PwC and sponsored by the International Project Management Association (IPMA) are beginning to appear. Established annual project controls surveys undertaken by Logikal are also now reflecting project data analytics in the questions that they ask. APM has sponsored the following three on-going research fund projects around project data analytics due to be published autumn 2021:   Dr Ronald Dyer, University of Sheffield This investigation examines the application of intelligent agents to the critical area of learning lessons across projects. It will investigate the use of ‘chatbots’ to identify and disseminate lessons learnt. (A chatbot is a software application that emulates a human by ‘chatting’ either by text or speech to guide the user through a task.) It will use this experience to reflect more widely on the use of AI in projects. Intelligent agents won’t be badged as AI but as a tool in the project manager’s arsenal.   Dr Ian Stewart, Dr Kun Wang, University of Manchester This investigation takes as its starting point the professional status of project managers and the tapestry of knowledge, skills and attitude that it takes to achieve professional status as a project practitioner. The investigation attempts to ‘unbox’ this knowledge to see if and how artificial intelligence could be used to replicate the functionality of this knowledge. This will allow the researchers to identify how networks of humans and intelligent agent could co-exist in a way that would improve project delivery performance.    Dr Nicholas Dacre, University of Southampton  This investigation provides an overview of the potential for AI in projects particularly through a big data perspective. As projects grow in complexity, project professionals increasingly are exposed to large swathes of big data across the three main attributes of volume, velocity, and variety. Professionals are tasked with managing the success-to-failure pendulum by applying an array of project data analytics throughout the project life cycle. APM have convened a Data Advisory Group which brings together professional bodies including the APM and the Major Projects Association (MPA), the Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA), academics, funding providers such as UKRI and leading organisations in the field of project data and analytics for example Projecting Success and Sir Robert McAlpine amongst others. The group aims to improve ‘data literacy’ enabling individuals and organisations to understand how they might be able to make better use of data, signposting developments and sharing learning.  This episode features contributors from academia and industry talking on the issue of project data analytics, what it means for project management and how it can benefit the delivery of successful projects. Project data analytics also featured as one of the Dynamic Conditions for Project Success, launched at our Power of Projects Conference.

Over… Data analytics refers to qualitative and quantitative techniques and processes used to enhance productivity and business gain. Data is extracted and categorized to identify and analyze behavioral data and patterns, and techniques vary according to organizational requirements. Data analytics is also known as data analysis. Data analytics is primarily conducted in business-to-consumer (B2C) applications. Global organizations collect and analyze data associated with customers, business processes, market economics or practical experience. Data is categorized, stored and analyzed to study purchasing trends and patterns. Evolving data facilitates thorough decision-making. For example, a social networking website collects data related to user preferences, community interests and segment according to specified criteria such as demographics, age or gender. Proper analysis reveals key user and customer trends and facilitates the social network's alignment of content, layout and overall strategy. Share This Article

"Data analytics are extremely important for risk managers. They improve decision-making, increase accountability, benefit financial health, and help employees predict losses and monitor performance. Not convinced? Check out two of our blog posts on the topic: Why All Risk Managers Should Use Data Analytics and 6 Reasons Data is Key for Risk Management. However, achieving these benefits is easier said than done. There are several challenges that can impede risk managers’ ability to collect and use analytics. Fortunately, there’s a solution:  With today’s data-driven organizations and the introduction of big data, risk managers and other employees are often overwhelmed with the amount of data that is collected. An organization may receive information on every incident and interaction that takes place on a daily basis, leaving analysts with thousands of interlocking data sets. There is a need for a data system that automatically collects and organizes information. Manually performing this process is far too time-consuming and unnecessary in today’s environment. An automated system will allow employees to use the time spent processing data to act on it instead. With so much data available, it’s difficult to dig down and access the insights that are needed most. When employees are overwhelmed, they may not fully analyze data or only focus on the measures that are easiest to collect instead of those that truly add value. In addition, if an employee has to manually sift through data, it can be impossible to gain real-time insights on what is currently happening. Outdated data can have significant negative impacts on decision-making. A data system that collects, organizes and automatically alerts users of trends will help solve this issue. Employees can input their goals and easily create a report that provides the answers to their most important questions. With real-time reports and alerts, decision-makers can be confident they are basing any choices on complete and accurate information. To be understood and impactful, data often needs to be visually presented in graphs or charts. While these tools are incredibly useful, it’s difficult to build them manually. Taking the time to pull information from multiple areas and put it into a reporting tool is frustrating and time-consuming. Strong data systems enable report building at the click of a button. Employees and decision-makers will have access to the real-time information they need in an appealing and educational format. The next issue is trying to analyze data across multiple, disjointed sources. Different pieces of data are often housed in different systems. Employees may not always realize this, leading to incomplete or inaccurate analysis. Manually combining data is time-consuming and can limit insights to what is easily viewed. With a comprehensive and centralized system, employees will have access to all types of information in one location. Not only does this free up time spent accessing multiple sources, it allows cross-comparisons and ensures data is complete. Moving data into one centralized system has little impact if it is not easily accessible to the people that need it. Decision-makers and risk managers need access to all of an organization’s data for insights on what is happening at any given moment, even if they are working off-site. Accessing information should be the easiest part of data analytics. An effective database will eliminate any accessibility issues. Authorized employees will be able to securely view or edit data from anywhere, illustrating organizational changes and enabling high-speed decision making. Nothing is more harmful to data analytics than inaccurate data. Without good input, output will be unreliable. A key cause of inaccurate data is manual errors made during data entry. This can lead to significant negative consequences if the analysis is used to influence decisions. Another issue is asymmetrical data: when information in one system does not reflect the changes made in another system, leaving it outdated. A centralized system eliminates these issues. Data can be input automatically with mandatory or drop-down fields, leaving little room for human error. System integrations ensure that a change in one area is instantly reflected across the board. As risk management becomes more popular in organizations, CFOs and other executives demand more results from risk managers. They expect higher returns and a large number of reports on all kinds of data. With a comprehensive analysis system, risk managers can go above and beyond expectations and easily deliver any desired analysis. They’ll also have more time to act on insights and further the value of the department to the organization. Data analytics can’t be effective without organizational support, both from the top and lower-level employees. Risk managers will be powerless in many pursuits if executives don’t give them the ability to act. Other employees play a key role as well: if they do not submit data for analysis or their systems are inaccessible to the risk manager, it will be hard to create any actionable information. Emphasize the value of risk management and analysis to all aspects of the organization to get past this challenge. Once other members of the team understand the benefits, they’re more likely to cooperate. Implementing change can be difficult, but using a centralized data analysis system allows risk managers to easily communicate results and effectively achieve buy-in from multiple stakeholders. Users may feel confused or anxious about switching from traditional data analysis methods, even if they understand the benefits of automation. Nobody likes change, especially when they are comfortable and familiar with the way things are done. To overcome this HR problem, it’s important to illustrate how changes to analytics will actually streamline the role and make it more meaningful and fulfilling. With comprehensive data analytics, employees can eliminate redundant tasks like data collection and report building and spend time acting on insights instead. Another challenge risk managers regularly face is budget. Risk is often a small department, so it can be difficult to get approval for significant purchases such as an analytics system. Risk managers can secure budget for data analytics by measuring the return on investment of a system and making a strong business case for the benefits it will achieve. For more information on gaining support for a risk management software system, check out our blog post here. Some organizations struggle with analysis due to a lack of talent. This is especially true in those without formal risk departments. Employees may not have the knowledge or capability to run in-depth data analysis. This challenge is mitigated in two ways: by addressing analytical competency in the hiring process and having an analysis system that is easy to use. The first solution ensures skills are on hand, while the second will simplify the analysis process for everyone. Everyone can utilize this type of system, regardless of skill level. Finally, analytics can be hard to scale as an organization and the amount of data it collects grows. Collecting information and creating reports becomes increasingly complex. A system that can grow with the organization is crucial to manage this issue. While overcoming these challenges may take some time, the benefits of data analysis are well worth the effort. Improve your organization today and consider investing in a data analytics system.

"Career Advice Jan 23, 2020 Read time: 1 min Share Data analysis and data analytics are often treated as interchangeable terms, but they hold slightly different meanings. Essentially, the primary difference between analytics and analysis is a matter of scale, as data analytics is a broader term of which data analysis is a subcomponent. Data analysis refers to the process of examining, transforming and arranging a given data set in specific ways in order to study its individual parts and extract useful information. Data analytics is an overarching science or discipline that encompasses the complete management of data. This not only includes analysis, but also data collection, organisation, storage, and all the tools and techniques used. It’s the role of the data analyst to collect, analyse, and translate data into information that’s accessible. By identifying trends and patterns, analysts help organisations make better business decisions. Their ability to describe, predict, and improve performance has placed them in increasingly high demand globally and across industries.1 Watch this short video where Norah Wulff, data architect and head of technology and operations at WeDoTech Limited, provides some more insight into how data analytics is different to data analysis. Wulff is head tutor on the Data Analysis online short course from the University of Cape Town. Data analysis allows for the evaluation of data through analytical and logical reasoning to lead to an outcome or conclusion within a stipulated context. It is a multifaceted process that involves a number of steps, approaches, and diverse techniques. The approach you take to data analysis depends largely on the type of data available for analysis and the purpose of the analysis.
